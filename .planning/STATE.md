## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

-

- [Phase 01]: CSherpaOnnx as .target with vendored headers (not .systemLibrary) for portability
- [Phase 01]: SHERPA_ONNX_PATH env var override pattern for path flexibility
- [Phase 01]: SherpaOnnxGetVersionStr is correct C API name (not SherpaOnnxGetVersion)
- [Phase 01]: SwiftTelegramBot is correct SPM product name (not SwiftTelegramSdk)
- [Phase 01]: strip release binary: 32MB unstripped -> 18.3MB stripped

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 (TTS): Word-to-phoneme alignment across diverse text is untested beyond Spike 16
- Phase 4 (Bot): 4,500 lines of TypeScript need line-by-line feature parity audit
- Phase 5 (Bot Core): Must use test bot token during dev to avoid long-polling conflict with production bot
