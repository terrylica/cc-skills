# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-27)

**Core value:** See what Claude says, anywhere -- real-time karaoke subtitles synced with TTS playback
**Current focus:** Phase 18 - CompanionCore Library & Test Infrastructure

## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 24 (CompanionCore Library & Test Infrastructure)
Plan: Ready to plan
Status: Ready to plan Phase 18
Last activity: 2026-03-27 — Roadmap created for v4.7.0 (phases 18-24)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 32
- Average duration: ~3 min
- Total execution time: ~1.5 hours

**By Phase (v4.6.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| 11    | 2     | 5min  | 2.5min   |
| 12    | 2     | 6min  | 3min     |
| 13    | 2     | 6min  | 3min     |
| 14    | 2     | 3min  | 1.5min   |
| 15    | 2     | 6min  | 3min     |
| 16    | 1     | 2min  | 2min     |
| 17    | 2     | 3min  | 1.5min   |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 2min, 5min, 1min, 2min, 1min
- Trend: Stable (~2.5min average)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Phase 17]: Generation counter pattern for interruption-safe work item scheduling in SubtitlePanel
- [Phase 16]: NSLock for thread safety (consistent with codebase -- to be replaced by actors in Phase 19)
- [v4.7.0]: CompanionCore library extraction must be first phase (SwiftPM cannot @testable import executable targets)
- [v4.7.0]: Blocking TTS synthesis stays on dedicated DispatchQueue bridged via withCheckedThrowingContinuation
- [v4.7.0]: Bionic and karaoke are mutually exclusive display modes (single DisplayMode enum)
- [v4.7.0]: Chinese model uses load-on-demand with 30-second idle cooldown

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Actor reentrancy bugs are NOT caught by Swift 6 compiler -- only code review and tests catch them
- CJK synthesis quality via sherpa-onnx kokoro-multi-lang-v1_0 is untested on this hardware
- Focus/DND relies on undocumented macOS private file -- deferred to future milestone
