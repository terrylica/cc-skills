# Post-Implementation Audit Report

**Feature**: Session-Chronicle S3 Artifact Sharing
**ADR**: [2026-01-02-session-chronicle-s3-sharing](/docs/adr/2026-01-02-session-chronicle-s3-sharing.md)
**Audit Date**: 2026-01-02
**Audit Type**: Comprehensive post-implementation verification

---

## Executive Summary

All implementation requirements have been verified. **23 files** created/modified as specified. All validation scripts pass. Real-data E2E tests confirm S3 upload/download and 1Password credential injection work correctly.

**One discrepancy identified and resolved**: `session_id` in s3-manifest-schema was specified in plan but correctly omitted in implementation (see RCA below).

## Discrepancy Analysis (Second-Chance Reconciliation)

### session_id in s3-manifest-schema

**Plan Specification (line 265-266)**:
```json
"required": ["version", "session_id", "created_at", "bucket", "prefix", "artifacts"]
```

**Implementation**:
```json
"required": ["version", "created_at", "bucket", "prefix", "artifacts"]
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. **What was specified**: Plan shows `session_id` as required field with format uuid
2. **What was implemented**: `session_id` is not present in required array or properties
3. **Investigation**: extract_session_chain.sh processes multiple sessions and outputs `chain_depth` to track multi-session traces
4. **Conclusion**: A single `session_id` would be semantically incorrect for a multi-session chain. The implementation correctly uses `chain_depth` and `uuid_chain.jsonl` instead.

**Decision**: No fix required. Implementation is correct; plan's schema template was overly prescriptive for the multi-session use case.
