# <PROJECT OR CAMPAIGN TITLE>

**This file IS the /loop prompt.** It is versioned, self-updates each firing, and git history tells the evolution story.

## How to invoke this loop

Put this in `/loop` (or `ScheduleWakeup.prompt`):

```
/loop

Read and execute the latest autonomous work contract at:
  <RELATIVE_PATH_TO_LOOP_CONTRACT_MD>

Follow its instructions verbatim. That file self-updates; this trigger stays fixed.
```

That's the entire `/loop` command going forward. The short trigger is stable; the contract below evolves.

---

## Core Directive (preserve verbatim across revisions)

<ONE PARAGRAPH describing the long-horizon goal. This section is the campaign's north star and must NOT be rewritten each firing. It describes WHAT + WHY, not HOW. Examples: "Find OOD-robust positively-yielding OOS trading rules across 4 FX symbols" or "Maintain green CI on main branch by investigating flaky tests as they surface".>

---

## Execution Contract

Each firing must:

1. **Orient** — read this file's Current State, ledger, last action in flight.
2. **Act** — execute the single highest-value next step from the Implementation Queue.
3. **Revise** — rewrite Current State + append to Revision Log + update Queue.
4. **Persist** — atomic commit(s), then schedule next wake-up with dynamic pacing.

### Phase 1 — Orient (never blind-execute)

```bash
tail -10 <LEDGER_FILE>              # what's been done
<status command e.g. pueue status>  # what's running in flight
git status --short | head -20       # working tree cleanliness
git log --oneline -5                # recent commits
```

Form a one-sentence assessment: _"Last firing finished X with Y result; next logical step is Z from the queue."_

### Phase 2 — Act (fill available time, not just one step)

Priority order (stop at the first match that has actionable work; then
continue to rule 6 if time/tokens remain):

1. If a long-running task is **in flight**: verify `Monitor` is armed on its output stream so the turn reacts as events arrive. Only arm a `ScheduleWakeup(1200-1800s)` heartbeat as a *safety net* (redundant in the happy path). If the queue has other non-conflicting items, keep working in the same turn — don't sleep.
2. If a Monitor event **just fired** (chain done): archive artifacts, write verdict, append ledger, commit atomically, pick next iteration.
3. If **uncommitted research artifacts** exist (git status dirty): commit as logical atomic group before starting new work.
4. If a **major milestone** just landed (cross-asset validation, composability proof, tier complete): consider `mise run release:full` per release rules.
5. If **nothing in flight + tree clean**: pick the next pending item from Implementation Queue; build, deploy, monitor.
6. **Continue filling available time** — after the primary step above, if a long-running task was merely launched (not blocked-waiting) and tokens remain, ALSO pop the next non-conflicting secondary queue item and make progress on it in the same firing. Idle waiting is the exception, not the norm. Suitable secondary items:
   - Documentation / CLAUDE.md updates triggered by the primary work
   - Refactors / lint fixes unrelated to the in-flight code path
   - Auditing commands (non-mutating) whose output informs the next primary step
   - Spawning independent `Agent` subtasks (in parallel) for research or validation that doesn't touch the mutating code path
7. If the **Implementation Queue is empty AND the only remaining work is an in-flight task you can't accelerate**: choose the cheapest waker tier that fits (see Phase 4 table). Prefer `Monitor` over `ScheduleWakeup`. If there is no in-flight task and the queue is empty, the loop's exit condition is met — do not schedule; stop honestly.

**Explicit rule — "continuation over idle":** a firing that produces
"scheduled next wake-up, did nothing else" is a regression whenever the
Implementation Queue has any non-blocked item. Reviewers should flag it.

### Phase 3 — Revise (this file)

Rewrite the **Current State** section. Remove completed queue items. Promote next-tier items when current tier empties. Preserve the Core Directive and Non-Obvious Learnings verbatim.

### Phase 4 — Persist, then choose a waker (cheapest tier that fits)

**Core principle**: every waker exists solely to make the main session resume. If the next iteration is ready right now, do not call a waker at all — chain in-turn.

| Tier | Mechanism | When to use | Cost |
| ---- | --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| **0 — In-turn continuation (default)** | No waker. Just start the next iteration in the same turn. | Implementation Queue has a ready item AND tokens remain. | Zero |
| **1 — `Monitor`** | Arm a `Monitor` on a background stream (build output, file-watch, log tail). The turn wakes on each emitted line. | An external event is the natural readiness signal, and you're still in-session. | Near-zero; cache warm |
| **2 — `ScheduleWakeup` (≤270s)** | Timer fires within the 5-min prompt-cache TTL. | Genuinely timed external blocker: API rate-limit window, deployment ETA, polled API with no webhook. | One warm turn of real-time wait |
| **3 — `ScheduleWakeup` (≥1200s)** | Long-sleep timer. Pay one prompt-cache miss on resume. | User away for a while; no sooner signal expected. | Cache miss + long wall-clock wait |
| **4 — External waker** (watchexec / systemd.timer) | Something outside Claude Code launches a fresh `claude --continue`. | Session has fully ended and we need to resume automatically across restarts. | Full cold-start of a new session |
| **Saturation detected (3 consecutive null rescues)** | **Omit the waker entirely** + `PushNotification`. | Loop has stalled. Stop honestly; user resumes manually. | — |

**Hard rules**:
1. **Never use `ScheduleWakeup` as pacing.** If the next iteration is queued, fire it in the same turn. `ScheduleWakeup` is strictly for *external* blockers.
2. **Never pick `ScheduleWakeup(300s)`** — worst of both (cache miss without amortizing). Stay ≤270s or jump ≥1200s.
3. **Heartbeats are safety nets, not triggers.** If `Monitor` is doing its job, the heartbeat fires as a no-op. If you rely on the heartbeat to advance, the `Monitor` filter is wrong.

A firing that produces "scheduled next wake-up, did nothing else" while the Implementation Queue has ready work is a regression. Reviewers should flag it.

```bash
git add <LOOP_CONTRACT_PATH> <artifacts>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
loop(iter-<N>): <one-line what this firing did>

<2-4 lines on decision + outcome + what next firing will do>
EOF
)"
```

Then schedule next firing with the pointer-trigger prompt above.

## Release Decision Rule

Trigger a release after ANY of:

1. **Tier completion** — all T1 items complete
2. **Cross-asset / cross-domain validation** — result reproduces across targets
3. **Composability proof** — a new layer compounds with existing layers
4. **Architectural pivot** — fundamental methodology change
5. **Research digest integrated** — external research landed into an implementation
6. **Explicit user ask** — "release" / "/mise:run-full-release"

If none apply, stay on the same version and keep committing atomic artifacts.

---

## Current State (auto-maintained — rewrite each firing)

**Last completed iteration**: <brief description of what just landed>

**Full current apex**: <the current best / summary of what's validated>

**Active monitors**: <none | monitor-id + description>

**Outstanding housekeeping**:

- [ ] <item 1>
- [x] <completed item>

---

## Implementation Queue

### Tier 1 (start here — ready-to-build, 1-3 days each)

- [ ] <action 1>
- [ ] <action 2>

### Tier 2 (1-2 weeks, production libraries available)

- [ ] <action>

### Tier 3 (2-4 weeks, academic prototypes)

- [ ] <action>

### Tier 4 (theoretical — defer to post-MVP)

- [ ] <action>

## Non-Obvious Learnings (preserve across revisions)

<Bulleted list of observations that would not be obvious to a fresh reader. Each entry includes the _why_ (the reason, often a past incident or strong preference) and the _how to apply_ (when/where this kicks in). Knowing _why_ lets you judge edge cases instead of blindly following the rule.>

- <learning 1>
- <learning 2>

## Revision Log (append-only, one line per firing)

- <YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC> — <one-line summary of the firing, what it decided, next intent>
