| New best practices      | Merge to SKILL.md              | Keep guidance current              |
| Script improvements     | Update references              | Don't copy, just update paths/docs |
| New structural patterns | Add to structural-patterns.md  | Expand pattern library             |
| Updated examples        | Evaluate & merge               | Improve clarity                    |
| API changes             | Skip                           | CLI-only skill                     |

### 4. Update This File

After syncing:
- Update "Last Sync" section with new commit SHA
- Document merged changes in "Content Sources"

## Marketplace vs User Skill Positioning

**Marketplace `skill-creator`**:
- Role: Executable tooling provider
- Focus: Scripts (init, package, validate)
- Auto-updates: Yes
- When used: Direct script execution needs

**User `skill-architecture`**:
- Role: Comprehensive creation guide
- Focus: Best practices, security, CLI features, your conventions
- Auto-updates: Manual sync (this process)
- When used: Learning, guidance, advanced topics

**Relationship**: Complementary, not competitive. Both enabled.

## Questions for Future Syncs

**Before merging new marketplace content, consider**:

1. **Does it duplicate existing content?**
   - If yes: Consolidate or reference

2. **Is it CLI-specific or API-only?**
   - API-only: Skip

3. **Does it conflict with user conventions?**
   - If yes: Adapt to Terry's standards

4. **Is it security-relevant?**
   - If yes: High priority merge

5. **Can it be referenced vs copied?**
   - Scripts: Always reference
   - Documentation: Consider progressive disclosure

**Automation Potential**: Low (requires judgment on content relevance)
