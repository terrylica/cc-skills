/**
 * PreToolUse hook: Umbrella-folder "never a repository" guard
 *
 * An UMBRELLA folder represents an owner/namespace and CONTAINS repositories.
 * It is not one itself. Operator ruling 2026-09-05:
 *
 *   "~/work should never become a repository because it is representing user,
 *    but never a repository."
 *
 * WHY A GUARD, WHEN A FILESYSTEM SENTINEL ALREADY EXISTS. Each umbrella folder
 * carries an immutable `.git` FILE (macOS `chflags uchg`) that makes `git init`
 * fail with `fatal: invalid gitfile format`. That is a harder stop than this
 * hook — but it is silent about WHY, and a cryptic error is exactly the thing a
 * helpful agent "fixes". This guard exists to refuse the command with a reason,
 * so the protection survives contact with the next session. Measured cause: an
 * agent proposed turning ~/work into a repository twice in one session.
 *
 * WHAT IT BLOCKS, when the resolved target is an umbrella folder itself:
 *   - `git init` (including `--separate-git-dir`, `--bare`)
 *   - `gh repo create` run from inside one
 *   - `git clone <url> <umbrella-path>` — cloning ONTO the folder
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT BLOCK:
 *   - anything targeting a SUBDIRECTORY (`~/work/newthing`) — nested repos are
 *     the entire point of an umbrella folder
 *   - `git init` anywhere else on the machine
 *
 * KNOWN GAP, stated rather than hidden: `GIT_DIR=/elsewhere git init` is not
 * matched by the filesystem sentinel because it never touches the folder's .git
 * path. It is matched here, which is the only layer that sees it.
 *
 * SSoT for the folder list: ~/.claude/path-owner-registry.toml, `[[umbrella]]`.
 * FAIL-OPEN: unreadable or unparseable registry -> allow. A guard that locks the
 * operator out of their own machine is worse than the thing it guards against.
 *
 * Escape hatch: ALLOW_UMBRELLA_REPO=1 anywhere in the command.
