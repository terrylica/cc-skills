# Configure a Macro Keyboard on macOS

End-to-end workflow for cheap 3-key USB-C/Bluetooth macro pads (Jieli, Realtek, CH57x, AliExpress-class): identify the device, figure out what each button actually emits, write a Karabiner rule scoped to that device only, and handle USB + Bluetooth in one rule even when the pad's BT firmware emits different keycodes than its USB side.

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: If a step breaks on a new pad, fix this file immediately. Every dead-end discovered belongs in `references/04-anti-patterns.md`.

## When to Use This Skill

- User mentions "macro pad", "macro keyboard", "3-key pad", "Stream Deck alternative" on macOS
- User wants to remap a cheap HID pad they bought from AliExpress / Amazon
- User wants buttons to emit Fn, Return, media keys, or custom shortcuts
- User hits a wall with BetterTouchTool (BTT can't emit real Fn — see sibling skill `emit-fn-key-on-macos`)
- User asks about dual USB + Bluetooth configuration for the same pad
- User mentions Jieli, Free3-P, or any pad with "USB Composite Device" as its product string

## Prerequisite Check

```bash
# 1. Karabiner-Elements installed?
test -d /Applications/Karabiner-Elements.app && echo OK || brew install --cask karabiner-elements

# 2. Input Monitoring + Accessibility granted?
#    System Settings → Privacy & Security → Input Monitoring → Karabiner = ON
#    System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → Karabiner = ON

# 3. On macOS Sequoia+: Login Items toggle for privileged daemon
#    System Settings → General → Login Items → Allow in the Background → Karabiner-Elements Privileged Daemon = ON
```

If any of the three is off, the remap will silently fail to grab the device.

## Workflow (5 Steps)

### Step 1 — Identify the device (USB)

```bash
# USB product string, VID, PID, serial, interface layout
ioreg -p IOUSB -l -w 0 | grep -B 2 -A 40 "USB Composite Device" | head -80

# Or system_profiler for a human-readable dump
system_profiler SPUSBDataType | grep -A 15 "USB Composite"
```

Record: `idVendor` (hex), `idProduct` (hex), product string, serial, interface count.

**Decode VID/PID → decimal** for Karabiner (Karabiner's JSON uses decimal):

```bash
python3 -c "print(int('0x4c4a', 16), int('0x4155', 16))"
# → 19530 16725
```

See `references/01-hardware-identification.md` for full decode of a Jieli pad including the HID report descriptor and how to infer the chip family.

### Step 2 — Identify the device (Bluetooth, if applicable)

Pair via System Settings → Bluetooth → Connect. Then:

```bash
# Pad's BT address + VID/PID + firmware
system_profiler SPBluetoothDataType | grep -A 20 "Free3-P\|<pad-name>"

# Confirm Karabiner sees it as a grabbable device
karabiner_cli --list-connected-devices | jq '.[] | select(.product == "<pad-name>")'
```

**Expect different VID/PID than USB**. Cheap pads borrow Samsung's `0x04E8` VID for macOS HID compatibility. Your one Karabiner rule must scope to both VID/PIDs via a single `device_if` with two identifiers.

See `references/08-bluetooth-configuration.md` for the Jieli/Free3-P live example.

### Step 3 — Discover what each button actually emits

Do not assume the stock mapping. Cheap pads ship with arbitrary keycodes (Jieli/Free3-P ships as Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V/Ctrl+X — _not_ cut/copy/paste convention — button order is hardware-random).

**Use `ignore: true` diagnostic rule** (zero-effect remap that logs raw events). See sibling skill `diagnose-hid-keycodes` for the full workflow. Quick version:

1. Add a disabled rule with `"conditions": [{"type": "device_if", "identifiers": [{...}]}]` and `"ignore": true` on the device
2. Open Karabiner-EventViewer → Main tab
3. Press each button, screenshot the emitted keycode
4. Repeat for BT (in each firmware mode if the pad has multiple)

### Step 4 — Write the Karabiner rule

Location: `~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` → profile 0 → `complex_modifications.rules` → append a new rule.

**Backup first**:

```bash
cp ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json.bak.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
```

**Rule skeleton** (one rule, N manipulators = buttons × transports):

```json
{
  "description": "<pad-name>: Top → Fn, Middle → Return, Bottom → Command+Delete",
  "manipulators": [
    {
      "type": "basic",
      "from": {
        "simultaneous": [{ "key_code": "left_control" }, { "key_code": "c" }],
        "simultaneous_options": {
          "detect_key_down_uninterruptedly": true,
          "key_down_order": "strict_inverse",
          "key_up_order": "strict_inverse",
          "to_after_key_up": []
        },
        "modifiers": { "optional": ["any"] }
      },
      "to": [{ "apple_vendor_top_case_key_code": "keyboard_fn" }],
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "device_if",
          "identifiers": [
            { "vendor_id": 19530, "product_id": 16725 },
            { "vendor_id": 1256, "product_id": 28705 }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

_(Repeat the manipulator block for middle, bottom, and the BT-mode variants — total 6 manipulators for a 3-key pad with USB + BT. JSON does not support `//` comments, so do not paste comment lines into your config.)_

**Five rules to remember**:

1. **`simultaneous` with `detect_key_down_uninterruptedly: true`** — needed when the pad emits modifier + key in one HID report. Default `mandatory` matcher misses these.
2. **`apple_vendor_top_case_key_code: keyboard_fn`** is the only way to emit real Fn. `key_code: fn` does nothing; `modifiers: ["fn"]` does nothing.
3. **`device_if` with MULTIPLE identifiers** — put the USB VID/PID and the BT VID/PID both in the same `identifiers` array. One rule handles both transports.
4. **Scope every manipulator to the device**. Without `device_if`, you'll remap your MacBook's built-in keyboard and break Apple's native keys.
5. **`modifiers: {"optional": ["any"]}`** — lets the firmware's modifier report flow through without blocking the rule.

Full live example (Jieli + Free3-P, 6 manipulators): `references/raw/karabiner-rule.json`.

### Step 5 — Verify the grab + test

```bash
# Karabiner sees and grabs the device
karabiner_cli --list-connected-devices | jq '.[] | select(.product == "<pad-name>") | {product, is_grabbed}'

# Should return {"product": "...", "is_grabbed": true}

# Live event test
open -a "Karabiner-EventViewer"
# Press buttons → should see your TARGET keycode, not the SOURCE
```

If `is_grabbed: false`, re-check Input Monitoring + Accessibility + Login Items (step Prerequisite Check).

If grabbed but buttons pass through unchanged: your `simultaneous` matcher is probably wrong — the pad emits the combo in one report but you wrote `mandatory`. Revisit step 3.

If real Fn stops working system-wide after your rule loads: **revert immediately**. Do not set `to_if_held_down` with `keyboard_fn` as the target — this breaks Fn-emission on the whole system (verified failure). See `references/04-anti-patterns.md` → "Tap-vs-hold Fn emission".

## Decision Tree: Which Target Keycode?

| You want button to emit…        | Target JSON                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Return / Enter                  | `{"key_code": "return_or_enter"}`                                    |
| Fn (for Typeless, dictation)    | `{"apple_vendor_top_case_key_code": "keyboard_fn"}`                  |
| Command+Delete (delete-to-home) | `{"key_code": "delete_or_backspace", "modifiers": ["left_command"]}` |
| Option+Delete (delete word)     | `{"key_code": "delete_or_backspace", "modifiers": ["left_option"]}`  |
| Media play/pause                | `{"consumer_key_code": "play_or_pause"}`                             |
| Volume up/down                  | `{"consumer_key_code": "volume_increment"}` / `volume_decrement`     |
| Launch an app                   | `{"shell_command": "open -a 'App Name'"}`                            |
| Run a shell command             | `{"shell_command": "/path/to/script.sh"}`                            |

## Handling Multiple BT Firmware Modes

Many cheap pads have 2-4 firmware modes that emit different keycodes per mode. The Jieli/Free3-P has 4 modes:

| Mode | Top                | Middle             | Bottom                  |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1    | `volume_increment` | `volume_decrement` | `spacebar` (play/pause) |
| 2    | (unexplored)       | —                  | —                       |
| 3    | (unexplored)       | —                  | —                       |
| 4    | `page_up`          | `page_down`        | `equal_sign`            |

**Pick the mode with the rarest keys** (mode 4 for Free3-P — page_up/page_down are rarely used on laptops). Then add manipulators that match those keycodes plainly (no `simultaneous` needed for single-key firmware modes).

Mode-switch combos are often undocumented. Common attempts: hold all 3 keys ≥ 5s, hold top alone ≥ 5s, press top+bottom simultaneously. Document what works when you find it.

See `references/08-bluetooth-configuration.md` for the full mode-4 setup.
