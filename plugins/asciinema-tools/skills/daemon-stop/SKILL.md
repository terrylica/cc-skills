# /asciinema-tools:daemon-stop

Stop the asciinema chunker daemon via launchd.

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If instructions are wrong, parameters drifted, or a workaround was needed — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## Execution

### Check if Running

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash << 'CHECK_EOF'
PLIST_PATH="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cc-skills.asciinema-chunker.plist"

if ! [[ -f "$PLIST_PATH" ]]; then
  echo "Daemon not installed."
  exit 0
fi

if ! launchctl list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "asciinema-chunker"; then
  echo "Daemon not running."
  exit 0
fi

echo "RUNNING"
CHECK_EOF
```

### Stop Daemon

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash << 'STOP_EOF'
PLIST_PATH="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cc-skills.asciinema-chunker.plist"

if launchctl unload "$PLIST_PATH"; then
  echo "Daemon stopped"

  # Verify
  sleep 1
  if launchctl list 2>/dev/null | grep -q "asciinema-chunker"; then
    echo "WARNING: Daemon may still be running"
  else
    echo "Confirmed: Daemon is no longer running"
  fi
else
  echo "ERROR: Failed to stop daemon"
  exit 1
fi
STOP_EOF
```

## Output

On success:

```
Daemon stopped
Confirmed: Daemon is no longer running
```

## Notes

- Stopping the daemon does NOT delete credentials from Keychain
- To restart: `/asciinema-tools:daemon-start`
- The daemon will NOT auto-start on next login until started again

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                   | Cause                    | Solution                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Failed to stop daemon   | Launchd error            | Try `launchctl unload -F <plist-path>`           |
| Daemon still running    | Multiple instances       | Kill manually: `pkill -f asciinema-chunker`      |
| Can't find plist        | Setup not run            | Run `/asciinema-tools:daemon-setup` first        |
| Recordings not stopping | asciinema rec is running | Exit recording shell first (Ctrl-D or type exit) |


## Post-Execution Reflection

After this skill completes, check before closing:

1. **Did the command succeed?** — If not, fix the instruction or error table that caused the failure.
2. **Did parameters or output change?** — If the underlying tool's interface drifted, update Usage examples and Parameters table to match.
3. **Was a workaround needed?** — If you had to improvise (different flags, extra steps), update this SKILL.md so the next invocation doesn't need the same workaround.

Only update if the issue is real and reproducible — not speculative.
