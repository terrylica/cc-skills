# Adaptive Walk-Forward Epoch Selection (AWFES)

Machine-readable reference for adaptive epoch selection within Walk-Forward Optimization (WFO). Optimizes training epochs per-fold using Walk-Forward Efficiency (WFE) as the objective.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Selecting optimal training epochs for ML models in WFO
- Avoiding overfitting via Walk-Forward Efficiency metrics
- Implementing per-fold adaptive epoch selection
- Computing efficient frontiers for epoch-performance trade-offs
- Carrying epoch priors across WFO folds

## Quick Start

```python
from adaptive_wfo_epoch import AWFESConfig, compute_efficient_frontier

# Generate epoch candidates from search bounds and granularity
config = AWFESConfig.from_search_space(
    min_epoch=100,
    max_epoch=2000,
    granularity=5,  # Number of frontier points
)
# config.epoch_configs → [100, 211, 447, 945, 2000] (log-spaced)

# Per-fold epoch sweep
for fold in wfo_folds:
    epoch_metrics = []
    for epoch in config.epoch_configs:
        is_sharpe, oos_sharpe = train_and_evaluate(fold, epochs=epoch)
        wfe = config.compute_wfe(is_sharpe, oos_sharpe, n_samples=len(fold.train))
        epoch_metrics.append({"epoch": epoch, "wfe": wfe, "is_sharpe": is_sharpe})

    # Select from efficient frontier
    selected_epoch = compute_efficient_frontier(epoch_metrics)

    # Carry forward to next fold as prior
    prior_epoch = selected_epoch
```

## Methodology Overview

### What This Is

Per-fold adaptive epoch selection where:

1. Train models across a range of epochs (e.g., 400, 800, 1000, 2000)
2. Compute WFE = OOS_Sharpe / IS_Sharpe for each epoch count
3. Find the "efficient frontier" - epochs maximizing WFE vs training cost
4. Select optimal epoch from frontier for OOS evaluation
5. Carry forward as prior for next fold

### What This Is NOT

- **NOT early stopping**: Early stopping monitors validation loss continuously; this evaluates discrete candidates post-hoc
- **NOT Bayesian optimization**: No surrogate model; direct evaluation of all candidates
- **NOT nested cross-validation**: Uses temporal WFO, not shuffled splits

## Core Formula: Walk-Forward Efficiency

```python
def compute_wfe(
    is_sharpe: float,
    oos_sharpe: float,
    n_samples: int | None = None,
) -> float | None:
    """Walk-Forward Efficiency - measures performance transfer.

    WFE = OOS_Sharpe / IS_Sharpe

    Interpretation (guidelines, not hard thresholds):
    - WFE ≥ 0.70: Excellent transfer (low overfitting)
    - WFE 0.50-0.70: Good transfer
    - WFE 0.30-0.50: Moderate transfer (investigate)
    - WFE < 0.30: Severe overfitting (likely reject)

    The IS_Sharpe minimum is derived from signal-to-noise ratio,
    not a fixed magic number. See compute_is_sharpe_threshold().

    Reference: Pardo (2008) "The Evaluation and Optimization of Trading Strategies"
    """
    # Data-driven threshold: IS_Sharpe must exceed 2σ noise floor
    min_is_sharpe = compute_is_sharpe_threshold(n_samples) if n_samples else 0.1

### IS_Sharpe Threshold: Signal-to-Noise Derivation

```python
def compute_is_sharpe_threshold(n_samples: int | None = None) -> float:

    Principle: IS_Sharpe must be statistically distinguishable from zero.

    Under null hypothesis (no skill), Sharpe ~ N(0, 1/√n).
    To reject null at α=0.05 (one-sided), need Sharpe > 1.645/√n.

    For practical use, we use 2σ threshold (≈97.7% confidence):
        threshold = 2.0 / √n

    This adapts to sample size:
    - n=100: threshold ≈ 0.20
    - n=400: threshold ≈ 0.10
    - n=1600: threshold ≈ 0.05

    Fallback for unknown n: 0.1 (assumes n≈400, typical fold size)

    Rationale for 0.1 fallback:
    - 2/√400 = 0.1, so 0.1 assumes ~400 samples per fold
    - This is conservative: 400 samples is typical for weekly folds
    - If actual n is smaller, threshold is looser (accepts more noise)
    - If actual n is larger, threshold is tighter (fine, we're conservative)
    - The 0.1 value also corresponds to "not statistically distinguishable
      from zero at reasonable sample sizes" - a natural floor for Sharpe SE
    """
    if n_samples is None or n_samples < 10:
        # Conservative fallback: 0.1 assumes ~400 samples (typical fold size)
        # Derivation: 2/√400 = 0.1; see rationale above
        return 0.1

    return 2.0 / np.sqrt(n_samples)
```

## Guardrails (Principled Guidelines)

### G1: WFE Thresholds

The traditional thresholds (0.30, 0.50, 0.70) are **guidelines based on practitioner consensus**, not derived from first principles. They represent:

| Threshold | Meaning     | Statistical Basis                                          |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **0.30**  | Hard reject | Retaining <30% of IS performance is almost certainly noise |
| **0.50**  | Warning     | At 50%, half the signal is lost - investigate              |
| **0.70**  | Target      | Industry standard for "good" transfer                      |

```python
# These are GUIDELINES, not hard rules
# Adjust based on your domain and risk tolerance
WFE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "hard_reject": 0.30,  # Below this: almost certainly overfitting
    "warning": 0.50,      # Below this: significant signal loss
    "target": 0.70,       # Above this: good generalization
}

def classify_wfe(wfe: float | None) -> str:
    """Classify WFE with principled thresholds."""
    if wfe is None:
        return "INVALID"  # IS_Sharpe below noise floor
    if wfe < WFE_THRESHOLDS["hard_reject"]:
        return "REJECT"
    if wfe < WFE_THRESHOLDS["warning"]:
        return "INVESTIGATE"
    if wfe < WFE_THRESHOLDS["target"]:
        return "ACCEPTABLE"
    return "EXCELLENT"
```

### G2: IS_Sharpe Minimum (Data-Driven)

**OLD (magic number):**

```python
# WRONG: Fixed threshold regardless of sample size
if is_sharpe < 1.0:
    wfe = None
```

**NEW (principled):**

```python
# CORRECT: Threshold adapts to sample size
min_is_sharpe = compute_is_sharpe_threshold(n_samples)
if is_sharpe < min_is_sharpe:
    wfe = None  # Below noise floor for this sample size
```

The threshold derives from the standard error of Sharpe ratio: SE(SR) ≈ 1/√n.

**Note on SE(Sharpe) approximation**: The formula `1/√n` is a first-order approximation valid when SR is small (close to 0). The full Lo (2002) formula is:

```
SE(SR) = √((1 + 0.5×SR²) / n)
```

For high-Sharpe strategies (SR > 1.0), the simplified formula underestimates SE by ~25-50%. Use the full formula when evaluating strategies with SR > 1.0.

### G3: Stability Penalty for Epoch Changes (Adaptive)

The stability penalty prevents hyperparameter churn. Instead of fixed thresholds, use **relative improvement** based on WFE variance:

```python
def compute_stability_threshold(wfe_history: list[float]) -> float:
    """Compute stability threshold from observed WFE variance.

    Principle: Require improvement exceeding noise level.

    If WFE has std=0.15 across folds, random fluctuation could be ±0.15.
    To distinguish signal from noise, require improvement > 1σ of WFE.

    Minimum: 5% (prevent switching on negligible improvements)
    Maximum: 20% (don't be overly conservative)
    """
    if len(wfe_history) < 3:
        return 0.10  # Default until enough history

    wfe_std = np.std(wfe_history)
    threshold = max(0.05, min(0.20, wfe_std))
    return threshold


class AdaptiveStabilityPenalty:
    """Stability penalty that adapts to observed WFE variance."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.wfe_history: list[float] = []
        self.epoch_changes: list[int] = []

    def should_change_epoch(
        self,
        current_wfe: float,
        candidate_wfe: float,
        current_epoch: int,
        candidate_epoch: int,
    ) -> bool:
        """Decide whether to change epochs based on adaptive threshold."""
        self.wfe_history.append(current_wfe)

        if current_epoch == candidate_epoch:
            return False  # Same epoch, no change needed

        threshold = compute_stability_threshold(self.wfe_history)
        improvement = (candidate_wfe - current_wfe) / max(abs(current_wfe), 0.01)

        if improvement > threshold:
            self.epoch_changes.append(len(self.wfe_history))
            return True

        return False  # Improvement not significant
```

### G4: DSR Adjustment for Epoch Search (Principled)

```python
def adjusted_dsr_for_epoch_search(
    sharpe: float,
    n_folds: int,
    n_epochs: int,

) -> float:
    """Deflated Sharpe Ratio accounting for epoch selection multiplicity.

    is inflated. This adjustment corrects for that selection bias.

    Principled SE estimation:
    - If n_samples provided: SE(Sharpe) ≈ 1/√n
    - Otherwise: estimate from typical fold size

    """
    from math import sqrt, log, pi

    n_trials = n_folds * n_epochs  # Total selection events

    if n_trials < 2:
        return sharpe  # No multiple testing correction needed

    # Expected maximum under null (Gumbel distribution)
    # E[max(Z_1, ..., Z_n)] ≈ √(2·ln(n)) - (γ + ln(π/2)) / √(2·ln(n))
    # where γ ≈ 0.5772 is Euler-Mascheroni constant
    euler_gamma = 0.5772156649
    sqrt_2_log_n = sqrt(2 * log(n_trials))
    e_max_z = sqrt_2_log_n - (euler_gamma + log(pi / 2)) / sqrt_2_log_n

    # Estimate Sharpe SE if not provided
    if sharpe_se is None:
        if n_samples_per_fold is not None:
            sharpe_se = 1.0 / sqrt(n_samples_per_fold)
        else:
            # Conservative default: assume ~300 samples per fold
            sharpe_se = 1.0 / sqrt(300)

    # Expected maximum Sharpe under null
    e_max_sharpe = e_max_z * sharpe_se

    # Deflated Sharpe
    return max(0, sharpe - e_max_sharpe)
```

**Example**: For 5 epochs × 50 folds = 250 trials with 300 samples/fold:

- `sharpe_se ≈ 0.058`
- `e_max_z ≈ 2.88`
- `e_max_sharpe ≈ 0.17`
- A Sharpe of 1.0 deflates to **0.83** after adjustment.

## WFE Aggregation Methods

**WARNING: Cauchy Distribution Under Null**

Under the null hypothesis (no predictive skill), WFE follows a **Cauchy distribution**, which has:

- No defined mean (undefined expectation)
- No defined variance (infinite)
- Heavy tails (extreme values common)

This makes **arithmetic mean unreliable**. A single extreme WFE can dominate the average. **Always prefer median or pooled methods** for robust WFE aggregation. See [references/mathematical-formulation.md](./references/mathematical-formulation.md) for the proof: `WFE | H0 ~ Cauchy(0, sqrt(T_IS/T_OOS))`.

### Method 1: Pooled WFE (Recommended for precision-weighted)

```python
def pooled_wfe(fold_results: list[dict]) -> float:
    """Weights each fold by its sample size (precision).

    Formula: Σ(T_OOS × SR_OOS) / Σ(T_IS × SR_IS)

    denominator = sum(r["n_is"] * r["is_sharpe"] for r in fold_results)

    if denominator < 1e-10:
        return float("nan")
    return numerator / denominator
```

### Method 2: Median WFE (Recommended for robustness)

```python
def median_wfe(fold_results: list[dict]) -> float:
    """Robust to outliers, standard in robust statistics.

    Advantage: Single extreme fold doesn't dominate.
    Use when: Suspected outlier folds (regime changes, data issues).
    """
    wfes = [r["wfe"] for r in fold_results if r["wfe"] is not None]
    return float(np.median(wfes)) if wfes else float("nan")
```

### Method 3: Weighted Arithmetic Mean

```python
def weighted_mean_wfe(fold_results: list[dict]) -> float:
    """Weights by inverse variance (efficiency weighting).

    Formula: Σ(w_i × WFE_i) / Σ(w_i)
    where w_i = 1 / Var(WFE_i) ≈ n_oos × n_is / (n_oos + n_is)

    Advantage: Optimal when combining estimates of different precision.
    Use when: All folds have similar characteristics.

| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Variable fold sizes | Pooled WFE         | Weights by precision    |

| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Expanding window (range bars)** | Train size grows per fold           | Use fixed sliding window          | CRITICAL |
| **Peak picking**                  | Best epoch always at sweep boundary | Expand range, check for plateau   | HIGH     |
| **Insufficient folds**            | effective_n < 30                    | Increase folds or data span       | HIGH     |
| **Ignoring temporal autocorr**    | Folds correlated                    | Use purged CV, gap between folds  | HIGH     |
| **Overfitting to IS**             | IS >> OOS Sharpe                    | Reduce epochs, add regularization | HIGH     |
| **sqrt(252) for crypto**          | Inflated Sharpe                     | Use sqrt(365) or sqrt(7) weekly   | MEDIUM   |
| **Single epoch selection**        | No uncertainty quantification       | Report confidence interval        | MEDIUM   |
| **Meta-overfitting**              | Epoch selection itself overfits     | Limit to 3-4 candidates max       | HIGH     |

**CRITICAL**: Never use expanding window for range bar ML training. Expanding windows create fold non-equivalence, regime dilution, and systematically bias risk metrics. See [references/anti-patterns.md](./references/anti-patterns.md) for the full analysis (Section 7).

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Compute base metrics** using `rangebar-eval-metrics:compute_metrics.py`
2. **Feed to AWFES** for epoch selection with `sharpe_tw` as primary signal
3. **Validate** with `psr > 0.85` and `dsr > 0.50` before deployment
4. **Monitor** `is_collapsed` and `prediction_autocorr` for model health

## OOS Application Phase

### Overview

After epoch selection via efficient frontier, apply the selected epochs to held-out test data for final OOS performance metrics. This phase produces "live trading" results that simulate deployment.

### Nested WFO Structure

AWFES uses **Nested WFO** with three data splits per fold:

```
                    AWFES: Nested WFO Data Split (per fold)

#############     +----------+     +---------+     +----------+     #==========#
# Train 60% # --> | Gap 6% A | --> | Val 20% | --> | Gap 6% B | --> H Test 20% H
#############     +----------+     +---------+     +----------+     #==========#

## Epoch Smoothing Methods

### Why Smooth Epoch Selections?

Raw per-fold epoch selections are noisy due to:

- Limited validation data per fold
- Regime changes between folds

Smoothing reduces variance while preserving signal.

### Method Comparison

| Method                     | Formula                   | Pros                            | Cons                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Bayesian (Recommended)** | Precision-weighted update | Principled, handles uncertainty | More complex                  |
| EMA                        | `α × new + (1-α) × old`   | Simple, responsive              | No uncertainty quantification |
| SMA                        | Mean of last N            | Most stable                     | Slow to adapt                 |
| Median                     | Median of last N          | Robust to outliers              | Loses magnitude info          |

### Bayesian Updating (Primary Method)

```python
def bayesian_epoch_update(
    prior_mean: float,
    prior_variance: float,
    observed_epoch: int,
    observation_variance: float,
    wfe_weight: float = 1.0,
) -> tuple[float, float]:
    """Single Bayesian update step.

    Mathematical formulation:
    - Prior: N(μ₀, σ₀²)
    - Observation: N(x, σ_obs²/wfe)  # WFE-weighted
    - Posterior: N(μ₁, σ₁²)

    Where:
    μ₁ = (μ₀/σ₀² + x·wfe/σ_obs²) / (1/σ₀² + wfe/σ_obs²)
    σ₁² = 1 / (1/σ₀² + wfe/σ_obs²)
    """
    # Effective observation variance (lower WFE = less reliable)
    eff_obs_var = observation_variance / max(wfe_weight, 0.1)

    prior_precision = 1.0 / prior_variance
    obs_precision = 1.0 / eff_obs_var

    posterior_precision = prior_precision + obs_precision
    posterior_mean = (
        prior_precision * prior_mean + obs_precision * observed_epoch
    ) / posterior_precision
    posterior_variance = 1.0 / posterior_precision

    return posterior_mean, posterior_variance
```

### Exponential Moving Average (Alternative)

```python
def ema_epoch_update(
    current_ema: float,
    observed_epoch: int,
    alpha: float = 0.3,
) -> float:
    """EMA update: more weight on recent observations.

    α = 0.3 means ~90% of signal from last 7 folds.
    α = 0.5 means ~90% of signal from last 4 folds.
    """
    return alpha * observed_epoch + (1 - alpha) * current_ema
```

### Initialization Strategies

| Strategy             | When to Use              | Implementation                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Midpoint prior**   | No domain knowledge      | `mean(epoch_configs)`                |
| **Literature prior** | Published optimal exists | Known optimal ± uncertainty          |
| **Burn-in**          | Sufficient data          | Use first N folds for initialization |

```python
# RECOMMENDED: Use AWFESConfig for principled derivation
config = AWFESConfig.from_search_space(
    min_epoch=80,
    max_epoch=400,
    granularity=5,
)
# prior_variance = ((400-80)/3.92)² ≈ 6,658 (derived automatically)
# observation_variance = prior_variance/4 ≈ 1,665 (derived automatically)

# Alternative strategies (if manual configuration needed):

# Strategy 1: Search-space derived (same as AWFESConfig)
epoch_range = max(EPOCH_CONFIGS) - min(EPOCH_CONFIGS)
prior_mean = np.mean(EPOCH_CONFIGS)
prior_variance = (epoch_range / 3.92) ** 2  # 95% CI spans search space

# Strategy 2: Burn-in (use first 5 folds)
burn_in_optima = [run_fold_sweep(fold) for fold in folds[:5]]
prior_mean = np.mean(burn_in_optima)
base_variance = (epoch_range / 3.92) ** 2 / 4  # Reduced after burn-in
prior_variance = max(np.var(burn_in_optima), base_variance)
```

## OOS Metrics Specification

### Metric Tiers for Test Evaluation

Following [rangebar-eval-metrics](../rangebar-eval-metrics/SKILL.md), compute these metrics on TEST data.

**CRITICAL for Range Bars**: Use time-weighted Sharpe (`sharpe_tw`) instead of simple bar Sharpe. See [range-bar-metrics.md](./references/range-bar-metrics.md) for the canonical implementation. The metrics below assume time-weighted computation for range bar data.

#### Tier 1: Primary Metrics (Mandatory)

| Metric                  | Formula                                  | Threshold | Purpose              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| `sharpe_tw`             | Time-weighted (see range-bar-metrics.md) | > 0       | Core performance     |
| `hit_rate`              | `n_correct_sign / n_total`               | > 0.50    | Directional accuracy |
| `cumulative_pnl`        | `Σ(pred × actual)`                       | > 0       | Total return         |
| `positive_sharpe_folds` | `n_folds(sharpe_tw > 0) / n_folds`       | > 0.55    | Consistency          |
| `wfe_test`              | `test_sharpe_tw / validation_sharpe_tw`  | > 0.30    | Final transfer       |

#### Tier 2: Risk Metrics

| Metric          | Formula                        | Threshold | Purpose        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | --------- | -------------- |
| `max_drawdown`  | `max(peak - trough) / peak`    | < 0.30    | Worst loss     |
| `calmar_ratio`  | `annual_return / max_drawdown` | > 0.5     | Risk-adjusted  |
| `profit_factor` | `gross_profit / gross_loss`    | > 1.0     | Win/loss ratio |
| `cvar_10pct`    | `mean(worst 10% returns)`      | > -0.05   | Tail risk      |

#### Tier 3: Statistical Validation

| Metric             | Formula                           | Threshold | Purpose                   |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| `psr`              | `P(true_sharpe > 0)`              | > 0.85    | Statistical significance  |
| `dsr`              | `sharpe - E[max_sharpe_null]`     | > 0.50    | Multiple testing adjusted |
| `binomial_pvalue`  | `binom.test(n_positive, n_total)` | < 0.05    | Sign test                 |
| `hac_ttest_pvalue` | HAC-adjusted t-test               | < 0.05    | Autocorrelation robust    |

## Look-Ahead Bias Prevention

### The Problem

Using the same data for epoch selection AND final evaluation creates look-ahead bias:

```
❌ WRONG: Use fold's own optimal epoch for fold's OOS evaluation
   - Epoch selection "sees" validation returns
   - Then apply same epoch to OOS from same period
   - Result: Overly optimistic performance
```

### The Solution: Nested WFO + Bayesian Lag

```
✅ CORRECT: Bayesian-smoothed epoch from PRIOR folds for current TEST
   - Epoch selection on train/validation (inner loop)
   - Update Bayesian posterior with validation-optimal
   - Apply Bayesian-selected epoch to TEST (outer loop)
   - TEST data completely untouched during selection
```

### v3 Temporal Ordering (CRITICAL - 2026 Fix)

The v3 implementation fixes a subtle but critical look-ahead bias bug in the original AWFES workflow. The key insight: **TEST must use `prior_bayesian_epoch`, NOT `val_optimal_epoch`**.

#### The Bug (v2 and earlier)

```python
# v2 BUG: Bayesian update BEFORE test evaluation
for fold in folds:
    epoch_metrics = sweep_epochs(fold.train, fold.validation)
    val_optimal_epoch = select_optimal(epoch_metrics)

    # WRONG: Update Bayesian with current fold's val_optimal
    bayesian.update(val_optimal_epoch, wfe)
    selected_epoch = bayesian.get_current_epoch()  # CONTAMINATED!

    # This selected_epoch is influenced by val_optimal from SAME fold
    test_metrics = evaluate(selected_epoch, fold.test)  # LOOK-AHEAD BIAS
```

#### The Fix (v3)

```python
# v3 CORRECT: Get prior epoch BEFORE any work on current fold
for fold in folds:
    # Step 1: FIRST - Get epoch from ONLY prior folds
    prior_bayesian_epoch = bayesian.get_current_epoch()  # BEFORE any fold work

    # Step 2: Train and sweep to find this fold's optimal
    epoch_metrics = sweep_epochs(fold.train, fold.validation)
    val_optimal_epoch = select_optimal(epoch_metrics)

    # Step 3: TEST uses prior_bayesian_epoch (NOT val_optimal!)
    test_metrics = evaluate(prior_bayesian_epoch, fold.test)  # UNBIASED

    # Step 4: AFTER test - update Bayesian for FUTURE folds only
    bayesian.update(val_optimal_epoch, wfe)  # For fold+1, fold+2, ...
```

#### Why This Matters

| Aspect                | v2 (Buggy)              | v3 (Fixed)          |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| When Bayesian updated | Before test eval        | After test eval     |
| Test epoch source     | Current fold influences | Only prior folds    |
| Information flow      | Future → Present        | Past → Present only |
| Expected bias         | Optimistic by ~10-20%   | Unbiased            |

#### Validation Checkpoint

```python
# MANDATORY: Log these values for audit trail
fold_log.info(
    f"Fold {fold_idx}: "
    f"prior_bayesian_epoch={prior_bayesian_epoch}, "
    f"val_optimal_epoch={val_optimal_epoch}, "
    f"test_uses={prior_bayesian_epoch}"  # MUST equal prior_bayesian_epoch
)
```

See [references/look-ahead-bias.md](./references/look-ahead-bias.md) for detailed examples.

### Embargo Requirements

| Boundary           | Embargo           | Rationale                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| Train → Validation | 6% of fold        | Prevent feature leakage   |
| Validation → Test  | 6% of fold        | Prevent selection leakage |
| Fold → Fold        | 1 hour (calendar) | Range bar duration        |

```python
def compute_embargo_indices(
    n_total: int,
    train_pct: float = 0.60,
    val_pct: float = 0.20,
    test_pct: float = 0.20,
    embargo_pct: float = 0.06,
) -> dict[str, tuple[int, int]]:
    """Compute indices for nested split with embargoes.

    Returns dict with (start, end) tuples for each segment.
    """
    embargo_size = int(n_total * embargo_pct)

    train_end = int(n_total * train_pct)
    val_start = train_end + embargo_size
    val_end = val_start + int(n_total * val_pct)
    test_start = val_end + embargo_size
    test_end = n_total

    return {
        "train": (0, train_end),
        "embargo_1": (train_end, val_start),
        "validation": (val_start, val_end),
        "embargo_2": (val_end, test_start),
        "test": (test_start, test_end),
    }
```

### Validation Checklist

Before running AWFES with OOS application:

- [ ] **Three-way split**: Train/Validation/Test clearly separated
- [ ] **Embargoes**: 6% gap at each boundary
- [ ] **Bayesian lag**: Current fold uses posterior from prior folds
- [ ] **No peeking**: Test data untouched until final evaluation
- [ ] **Temporal order**: No shuffling, strict time sequence
- [ ] **Feature computation**: Features computed BEFORE split, no recalculation

### Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern                                     | Detection                              | Fix                    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Using current fold's epoch on current fold's OOS | `selected_epoch == fold_optimal_epoch` | Use Bayesian posterior |
| Validation overlaps test                         | Date ranges overlap                    | Add embargo            |
| Features computed on full dataset                | Scaler fit includes test               | Per-split scaling      |
| Fold shuffling                                   | Folds not time-ordered                 | Enforce temporal order |
