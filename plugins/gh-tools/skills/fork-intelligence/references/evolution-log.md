## 2026-02-18: Initial Creation

- Created skill from empirical methodology developed across 10 repositories
- 7-step pipeline with signal priority order
- Domain-specific patterns for 6 codebase types
- Quantitative evidence: stars miss 60-100% of substantive forks
- Reference files: signal-priority.md, domain-patterns.md, empirical-data.md
- Original methodology developed in tensortrade fork analysis session, then validated across backtesting.py, kokoro, pymoo, firecrawl, barter-rs, pueue, dukascopy-node, ArcticDB, flowsurface
