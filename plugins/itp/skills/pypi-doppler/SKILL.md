# PyPI Publishing with Doppler (Local-Only)

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If instructions are wrong, parameters drifted, or a workaround was needed — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:

- Publishing Python packages to PyPI from local machine
- Setting up Doppler for PyPI token management
- Creating local publish scripts with CI detection guards
- Validating repository ownership before release

## WORKSPACE-WIDE POLICY: LOCAL-ONLY PUBLISHING

**This skill supports LOCAL machine publishing ONLY.**

### FORBIDDEN

- Publishing from GitHub Actions
- Publishing from any CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, CircleCI)
- `publishCmd` in semantic-release configuration
- Building packages in CI (`uv build` in prepareCmd)
- Storing PyPI tokens in GitHub secrets

### REQUIRED

- Use `scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh` on local machine
- CI detection guards in publish script
- Manual approval before each release
- Doppler credential management (no plaintext tokens)
- Repository verification (prevents fork abuse)

### Rationale

- **Security**: No long-lived PyPI tokens in GitHub secrets
- **Speed**: 30 seconds locally vs 3-5 minutes in CI
- **Control**: Manual approval step before production release
- **Flexibility**: Centralized credential management via Doppler

**See**: ADR-0027, `docs/development/PUBLISHING.md`

## Overview

This skill provides **local-only PyPI publishing** using Doppler for secure credential management. It integrates with the workspace-wide release workflow where:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Automated versioning ONLY (tags, releases, CHANGELOG)
2. **Local Machine**: Manual PyPI publishing with Doppler credentials

## Bundled Scripts

| Script                                                       | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [`scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh`](./scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh) | Local PyPI publishing with CI detection guards |

**Usage**: Copy to your project's `scripts/` directory:

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash << 'DOPPLER_EOF'
# Environment-agnostic path
PLUGIN_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/itp}"
cp "$PLUGIN_DIR/skills/pypi-doppler/scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh" scripts/
chmod +x scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh
DOPPLER_EOF
```

---

## Prerequisites

### One-Time Setup

1. **Install Doppler CLI**:

   ```bash
   brew install dopplerhq/cli/doppler
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Doppler**:

   ```bash
   doppler login
   ```

3. **Verify access to `claude-config` project**:

   ```bash
   doppler whoami
   doppler projects
   ```

### PyPI Token Setup

1. **Create PyPI API token**:
   - Visit: <https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/>
   - Enable 2FA if not already enabled (required since 2024)
   - Create token with scope: "Entire account" or specific project
   - Copy token (starts with `pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmc...`, ~180 characters)

2. **Store token in Doppler**:

   ```bash
   doppler secrets set PYPI_TOKEN='pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmc...' \
     --project claude-config \
     --config prd
   ```

3. **Verify token stored**:

   ```bash
   doppler secrets get PYPI_TOKEN \
     --project claude-config \
     --config prd \
     --plain
   ```

## Publishing Workflow

### MANDATORY: Verify Version Increment Before Publishing

**Pre-publish validation**: Before publishing to PyPI, verify that the version has incremented from the previous release. Publishing without a version increment is invalid and wastes resources.

**Autonomous check sequence**:

1. Compare local `pyproject.toml` version against latest PyPI version
2. If versions match -- **STOP** - do not proceed with publishing
3. Inform user: "Version not incremented. Run semantic-release first or verify commits include `feat:` or `fix:` types."

### Complete Release Workflow

**Step 1: Development & Commit** (Conventional Commits):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"  # MINOR bump
git push origin main
```

**Step 2: Automated Versioning** (GitHub Actions - 40-60s):

GitHub Actions automatically: analyzes commits, determines next version, updates `pyproject.toml`/`package.json`, generates CHANGELOG, creates git tag, creates GitHub release.

**PyPI publishing does NOT happen here** (by design - see ADR-0027).

**Step 3: Local PyPI Publishing** (30 seconds):

```bash
git pull origin main
./scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh
```

### Using Bundled Script (Recommended)

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash << 'GIT_EOF'
# First time: copy script from skill to your project (environment-agnostic)
PLUGIN_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/itp}"
cp "$PLUGIN_DIR/skills/pypi-doppler/scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh" scripts/
chmod +x scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh

# After semantic-release creates GitHub release
git pull origin main

# Publish using local copy of bundled script
./scripts/publish-to-pypi.sh
GIT_EOF
```

**Bundled script features**: CI detection guards, repository verification, Doppler integration, build + publish + verify workflow, clear error messages.

### Manual Publishing (Advanced)

For manual publishing without the canonical script:

```bash
/usr/bin/env bash << 'CONFIG_EOF'
# Retrieve token from Doppler
PYPI_TOKEN=$(doppler secrets get PYPI_TOKEN \
  --project claude-config \
  --config prd \
  --plain)

# Build package
uv build

# Publish to PyPI
UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN="${PYPI_TOKEN}" uv publish
CONFIG_EOF
```

**WARNING**: Manual publishing bypasses CI detection guards and repository verification. Use canonical script unless you have a specific reason not to.

## Post-Execution Reflection

After this skill completes, check before closing:

1. **Did the command succeed?** — If not, fix the instruction or error table that caused the failure.
2. **Did parameters or output change?** — If the underlying tool's interface drifted, update Usage examples and Parameters table to match.
3. **Was a workaround needed?** — If you had to improvise (different flags, extra steps), update this SKILL.md so the next invocation doesn't need the same workaround.

Only update if the issue is real and reproducible — not speculative.
