> Implement-The-Plan workflow: ADR-driven 4-phase development with preflight, implementation, formatting, and release automation.

**Hub**: [Root CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md) | **Sibling**: [itp-hooks CLAUDE.md](../itp-hooks/CLAUDE.md)

## Overview

Execute approved plans from Claude Code's Plan Mode through an ADR-driven 4-phase workflow: preflight → implementation → formatting → release. The neutral acronym "ITP" avoids action inference that caused Claude to skip preflight.

## 4-Phase Workflow

```
Preflight (ADR + Spec) → Phase 1 (Implement) → Phase 2 (Format) → Phase 3 (Release)
```

1. **Preflight**: Creates ADR (MADR 4.0), design spec, and graph-easy diagrams
2. **Phase 1**: Implement from design spec with TodoWrite tracking
3. **Phase 2**: Format with Prettier, push to GitHub
4. **Phase 3**: Release with semantic-release (main/master only)

## Plan Mode Bridge

Two paths from Plan Mode to `/itp:go`:

| Path                              | Steps          | Interface                               |
| --------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **A**: Type in rejection feedback | Fewer (direct) | Plain text field                        |
| **B**: Defer to command prompt    | Extra step     | Native slash commands with autocomplete |
