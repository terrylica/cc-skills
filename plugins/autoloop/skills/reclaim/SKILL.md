# autoloop: Reclaim

Forcibly reclaim ownership of a loop that appears stuck (dead owner or stale heartbeat). This skill performs an atomic takeover, increments the generation counter, and logs the event in the revision-log.

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If instructions are wrong, parameters drifted, or a workaround was needed — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## Arguments

- Positional (optional): a loop identifier. Three forms accepted, all routed through `resolve_loop_identifier`:
  - `<loop_id>` — bare 12 hex chars, e.g. `3555bbe1f0fb`
  - `AL-<slug>--<hash>` — display-name with disambiguator, e.g. `AL-odb-research--a1b2c3` (matches the on-disk `.autoloop/<slug>--<hash>/` directory)
  - `AL-<slug>` — display-name without disambiguator, e.g. `AL-flaky-ci-watcher`. Errors with a candidate list if multiple campaigns share the slug.

## Step 1: Identify the loop

```bash
INPUT="${1:-}"
if [ -z "$INPUT" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: identifier required. Try one of:"
  echo "  /autoloop:reclaim <loop_id>            (e.g. 3555bbe1f0fb)"
  echo "  /autoloop:reclaim AL-<slug>            (e.g. AL-odb-research)"
  echo "  /autoloop:reclaim AL-<slug>--<hash>    (e.g. AL-odb-research--a1b2c3)"
  echo "  Run /autoloop:status to list active campaigns by name."
  exit 1
fi

# Source the resolver and translate any input form to the canonical loop_id.
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autoloop}"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/registry-lib.sh" || {
  echo "ERROR: Failed to source registry-lib.sh" >&2
  exit 1
}

if ! LOOP_ID=$(resolve_loop_identifier "$INPUT"); then
  # resolve_loop_identifier already printed the error context to stderr (no
  # match / ambiguous slug / refused regex). Exit code 2 = ambiguity, in
  # which case the candidate list was printed and the user picks one.
  # Wave 5 A6: when no match was found, surface the closest registered
  # loops so the user has a concrete candidate to retry with instead of
  # a bare "not in registry" error.
  SUGGESTIONS=$(suggest_closest_loops "$INPUT" 2>/dev/null)
  if [ -n "$SUGGESTIONS" ]; then
    echo "" >&2
    echo "Did you mean one of these?" >&2
    echo "$SUGGESTIONS" >&2
    echo "" >&2
    echo "Run /autoloop:status to see the full registered fleet." >&2
  fi
  exit 1
fi
```

## Step 2: Source ownership library and check reclaim candidacy

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autoloop}"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/ownership-lib.sh" || {
  echo "ERROR: Failed to source ownership-lib.sh" >&2
  exit 1
}
```

Check if the loop is a reclaim candidate:

```bash
CANDIDATE=$(is_reclaim_candidate "$LOOP_ID")

if [ "$CANDIDATE" = "no" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Loop $LOOP_ID does not exist in the registry."
  exit 1
elif [ "$CANDIDATE" = "owner_alive" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Loop $LOOP_ID has a live owner and fresh heartbeat. Reclaim not needed."
  echo "       Use /autoloop:stop to cleanly terminate an active loop."
  exit 1
fi
```

If `$CANDIDATE = "yes"`, proceed to Step 3.

## Step 3: Show owner info and prompt confirmation

Read the registry entry to display owner information:

```bash
ENTRY=$(jq --arg id "$LOOP_ID" '.loops[] | select(.loop_id == $id)' "$HOME/.claude/loops/registry.json" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -z "$ENTRY" ] || [ "$ENTRY" = "{}" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: Registry entry not found for loop $LOOP_ID"
  exit 1
fi

# Source state-lib for the human-readable display name.
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/state-lib.sh" 2>/dev/null || true
DISPLAY_NAME=$(format_loop_display_name "$LOOP_ID" 2>/dev/null || echo "AL-loop-${LOOP_ID:0:6}")

OWNER_PID=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.owner_pid // "unknown"')
OWNER_SESSION=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.owner_session_id // "unknown"')
GENERATION=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.generation // 0')
CONTRACT_PATH=$(echo "$ENTRY" | jq -r '.contract_path // "unknown"')
STALENESS=$(staleness_seconds "$LOOP_ID")
```

Format confirmation message:

```
Loop: $DISPLAY_NAME ($LOOP_ID)
Current owner PID: $OWNER_PID
Current owner session: $OWNER_SESSION (last seen $STALENESS seconds ago)
Current generation: $GENERATION
Contract path: $CONTRACT_PATH

WARNING: Reclaiming will:
  1. Increment generation counter to $(($GENERATION + 1))
  2. Transfer ownership to this session
  3. Log a takeover event in the revision-log
  4. The original owner may conflict if it resumes

Proceed with reclaim?
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` with "Yes, reclaim" / "Cancel" options.

If user selects "Cancel", exit with status 0 (not an error).

## Step 4: Atomically reclaim the loop

Once confirmed:

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autoloop}"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/ownership-lib.sh" || exit 1

if reclaim_loop "$LOOP_ID" --reason "user_request"; then
  NEW_GEN=$(jq -r --arg id "$LOOP_ID" '.loops[] | select(.loop_id == $id) | .generation' "$HOME/.claude/loops/registry.json" 2>/dev/null)
  echo "✓ Reclaimed $DISPLAY_NAME ($LOOP_ID)"
  echo "  New generation: $NEW_GEN"
  exit 0
else
  echo "ERROR: Failed to reclaim $DISPLAY_NAME ($LOOP_ID) — it may have been reclaimed or deleted concurrently"
  exit 1
fi
```

## Step 5: Print next steps

After successful reclaim:

```
Ready to resume the loop. Next steps:

1. Review the contract at: $CONTRACT_PATH
2. Verify its state (iteration, Current State section, etc.)
3. Run /autoloop:start $CONTRACT_PATH to resume

Or, to clean up:
4. Run /autoloop:stop $CONTRACT_PATH if the loop is no longer needed
```

## Anti-patterns

- Do NOT reclaim an active loop without confirmation — this will conflict with the running owner
- Do NOT change the contract file before the new owner reads it — generation mismatch will cause confusion
- Do NOT use reclaim as a workaround for slow loops — use `/autoloop:stop` and `/autoloop:start` instead

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                                | Fix                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "does not exist in the registry"       | Loop was never registered; use `/autoloop:start` instead             |
| "has a live owner and fresh heartbeat" | Don't forcibly reclaim; use `/autoloop:stop` to shut it down cleanly |
| "Failed to reclaim loop"               | Registry file was deleted or unreadable; reinstall the plugin        |

## Post-Execution Reflection

0. **Locate yourself.** — Confirm this SKILL.md is the canonical file before any edit.
1. **What failed?** — Fix the instruction that caused it.
2. **What drifted?** — Update confirmation message template if needed.
3. **Log it.** — Evolution-log entry.
