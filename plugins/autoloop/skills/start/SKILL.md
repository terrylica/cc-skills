# autonomous-loop: Start

Scaffold `LOOP_CONTRACT.md` and start a self-revising `/loop` that reads the contract each firing.

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If instructions are wrong, parameters drifted, or a workaround was needed — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## Arguments

- Positional (optional): contract file path. Defaults to `./LOOP_CONTRACT.md`.

## Step 1: Ensure hooks are installed

Install BOTH autonomous-loop hooks into `~/.claude/settings.json` if not already present. Idempotent.

- **PostToolUse → `heartbeat-tick.sh`** — ticks heartbeat on every tool invocation, detects cwd drift.
- **SessionStart → `session-bind.sh`** — authoritatively binds `owner_session_id` from stdin payload (replaces broken `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env-var capture; ref [anthropics/claude-code#47018](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/47018)).
- **PreToolUse(ScheduleWakeup) → `pacing-veto.sh`** — denies pacing-disguised wakers (delays in the 300–1199s cache-miss zone, or any >270s with token-budget/cache-warm/self-pacing/cooldown/rest in the reason text). Forces Tier 0 (in-turn) when no real external blocker exists.

```bash
# Source the hook install library
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autonomous-loop}"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/hook-install-lib.sh"

# Install BOTH hooks (idempotent)
if ! install_all_hooks 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "WARNING: Failed to install autonomous-loop hooks; continuing anyway" >&2
fi
```

Result: every Claude session opening in a registered loop's contract dir will (1) bind to the loop on SessionStart, then (2) tick heartbeat with cwd-drift detection on every tool invocation.

## Step 2: Preflight

Check whether a contract already exists at the target path.

```bash
CONTRACT_PATH="${1:-./LOOP_CONTRACT.md}"
if [ -f "$CONTRACT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "EXISTS — user should be asked whether to resume or overwrite"
else
  echo "ABSENT — safe to scaffold"
fi
```

If `EXISTS`: use `AskUserQuestion` to choose between `resume` (run `/autonomous-loop:status` instead of starting fresh) or `overwrite` (proceed with Step 3).

## Step 3: Collect contract inputs

Use `AskUserQuestion` to collect:

```
1. name        — short slug for this loop (e.g. "odb-research", "flaky-ci-watcher")
2. scope       — one-line Core Directive describing the long-horizon goal
3. location    — path for the contract file (default: ./LOOP_CONTRACT.md)
4. cadence     — typical wake-up cadence hint (continuous | event-driven | hourly | daily)
```

## Step 4: Scaffold the contract

Copy the plugin-shipped template and substitute placeholders. Use
`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (set by Claude Code for every plugin skill) to
resolve the template — **do not use `$0`**, which is not set when a
SKILL.md is loaded as instructions rather than executed as a script.

```bash
# CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT points at /…/plugins/<plugin-name> when invoked from
# a skill. Fall back to the marketplace cache path if unset (e.g., when a
# user invokes the skill's Bash manually outside the harness).
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autonomous-loop}"
TEMPLATE="$PLUGIN_ROOT/templates/LOOP_CONTRACT.template.md"
if [ ! -f "$TEMPLATE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: template missing at $TEMPLATE — reinstall the plugin" >&2
  exit 1
fi
cp "$TEMPLATE" "$CONTRACT_PATH"
```

Then inject user inputs via `sed` (or Edit the file via Claude's tools):

- `<SHORT_DESCRIPTIVE_NAME>` → user-provided `name`
- `<ISO_8601_UTC>` → `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` (always `-u`; bare `date` returns local time and silently mismatches the contract's UTC fields)
- `<RELATIVE_PATH_TO_LOOP_CONTRACT_MD>` → `$CONTRACT_PATH`
- `<CORE DIRECTIVE>` / `<PROJECT OR CAMPAIGN TITLE>` → user-provided `scope`

## Step 5: Register loop in machine registry

After deriving the loop ID in Step 2/3, register this loop in the machine-level registry.

> **`owner_session_id` is set to `pending-bind` here.** The SessionStart hook (`hooks/session-bind.sh`) replaces it atomically on the next session start, because `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var is **not populated** in skill Bash subprocesses ([anthropics/claude-code#47018](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/47018)). Capturing it inline would always store empty/garbage — the hook is the only correct binding site.

```bash
# Source the registry library
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autonomous-loop}"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/registry-lib.sh"

# Derive loop_id from contract path (if not already done)
loop_id=$(derive_loop_id "$CONTRACT_PATH")

# Create entry JSON with all required fields. owner_session_id="pending-bind"
# is the canonical placeholder; the SessionStart hook replaces it atomically
# on the next session start. bound_cwd starts empty; heartbeat-tick records
# it on the first tick and detects drift thereafter.
entry=$(jq -n \
  --arg loop_id "$loop_id" \
  --arg contract_path "$(realpath "$CONTRACT_PATH")" \
  --arg state_dir "$(dirname "$CONTRACT_PATH")/.loop-state/$loop_id/" \
  --arg owner_session_id "pending-bind" \
  --arg bound_cwd "" \
  --arg owner_pid "$$" \
  --arg owner_start_time_us "$(date +%s%N | cut -c1-16)" \
  --arg launchd_label "com.user.claude.loop.$loop_id" \
  --arg started_at_us "$(date +%s%N | cut -c1-16)" \
  --arg expected_cadence_seconds "$cadence_seconds" \
  --arg generation "0" \
  '{loop_id: $loop_id, contract_path: $contract_path, state_dir: $state_dir, owner_session_id: $owner_session_id, bound_cwd: $bound_cwd, owner_pid: $owner_pid, owner_start_time_us: $owner_start_time_us, launchd_label: $launchd_label, started_at_us: $started_at_us, expected_cadence_seconds: $expected_cadence_seconds, generation: $generation}')

# Register in machine registry (atomic, serialized write)
if ! register_loop "$entry"; then
  echo "WARNING: Failed to register loop in machine registry (may already exist)" >&2
fi
```

## Step 6: Generate and load launchd plist

After registering the loop, generate the launchd plist and load it:

```bash
# Source the launchd library
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/autonomous-loop}"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/launchd-lib.sh"
source "$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/state-lib.sh"

# Derive loop_id and state_dir
loop_id=$(derive_loop_id "$CONTRACT_PATH")
state_dir=$(state_dir_path "$loop_id" "$CONTRACT_PATH")

# Stub waker script path (Phase 9 will ship the actual script)
waker_script="$PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/waker.sh"

# Calculate polling interval (default 150 seconds = half of typical cadence)
interval_seconds="${cadence_seconds:-300}"
interval_seconds=$((interval_seconds / 2))
if [ "$interval_seconds" -lt 60 ]; then
  interval_seconds=60
fi

# Generate plist
if ! generate_plist "$loop_id" "$state_dir" "$waker_script" "$interval_seconds"; then
  echo "WARNING: Failed to generate launchd plist" >&2
fi

# Load plist (bootstraps on macOS; skipped gracefully on non-macOS)
if ! load_plist "$loop_id" "$state_dir" 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "WARNING: Failed to load launchd plist" >&2
fi
```

## Step 7: Emit pointer trigger (updated from Step 7)

Print the snippet the user can feed to `/loop`:

```
/loop

Read and execute the latest autonomous work contract at:
  $CONTRACT_PATH

Follow its instructions verbatim. That file self-updates; this trigger stays fixed.
```

## Step 8: Offer to start the loop immediately

Use `AskUserQuestion` with two options:

- `Start now` — invoke the native `/loop` skill via `Skill(loop)` with the pointer trigger as input
- `Not yet` — user will invoke `/loop` manually (e.g. after committing the contract)

If `Start now`, call `Skill(loop)` with the pointer trigger snippet as `args`. Otherwise print "Contract scaffolded at `$CONTRACT_PATH`. Run `/loop` with the pointer trigger above whenever ready."

## Step 9: Suggest commit

Print a suggested first commit:

```bash
git add "$CONTRACT_PATH"
git commit -m "loop(bootstrap): scaffold LOOP_CONTRACT.md for $name"
```

## Anti-patterns

- Do NOT overwrite an existing contract without explicit user confirmation
- Do NOT write the contract to a dir outside the current working tree (sandbox bypass)
- Do NOT invoke `/loop` with the full Core Directive as prompt — always use the short pointer trigger pattern

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                             | Fix                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Template not found                  | `claude plugin reinstall autonomous-loop@cc-skills`          |
| `/loop` says "unknown skill"        | Claude Code version < 2.1.101; upgrade to get native `/loop` |
| Pointer trigger re-reads stale file | Ensure `$CONTRACT_PATH` is absolute or CWD-stable            |

## Post-Execution Reflection

0. **Locate yourself.** — Confirm this SKILL.md is the canonical file before any edit.
1. **What failed?** — Fix the instruction that caused it.
2. **What drifted?** — Update the template if it's out of sync with the latest idiom.
3. **Log it.** — Evolution-log entry with trigger, fix, evidence.
