# Perspectives Taxonomy (11 Types)

Use `perspectives` in ADR frontmatter to describe how the ADR relates to the broader ecosystem.

## Taxonomy Table

| Perspective                   | Description                                          | Example Use Case                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `ProviderToOtherComponents`   | Creating something for others to consume             | Building a shared library or API           |
| `HostPlatformForContributors` | Building a framework others contribute to            | Plugin system, extension architecture      |
| `StandaloneComponent`         | Self-contained exploration, no external dependencies | Proof of concept, isolated experiment      |
| `UpstreamIntegration`         | Consuming external frameworks/infrastructure         | Integrating third-party API or SDK         |
| `BoundaryInterface`           | Public APIs, adapters, contract definitions          | REST API design, GraphQL schema            |
| `OperationalService`          | Runtime, SRE, observability concerns                 | Monitoring setup, alerting configuration   |
| `SecurityBoundary`            | Security, compliance, threat modeling                | Auth implementation, data encryption       |
| `ProductFeature`              | User-facing value, UX decisions                      | New feature for end users                  |
| `EcosystemArtifact`           | SDK, templates, reference implementations            | CLI tool, starter template                 |
| `LifecycleMigration`          | Versioning, deprecation, migration strategies        | Database migration, API version bump       |
| `OwnershipGovernance`         | Organizational, process, ownership decisions         | Team ownership, code review policy         |

## Usage in Frontmatter

```yaml
---
perspectives: [UpstreamIntegration, BoundaryInterface]
---
```

Multiple perspectives can apply to a single ADR.

## Selection Guide

### When to Use Each Perspective

**ProviderToOtherComponents**
- Building shared utilities consumed by multiple projects
- Creating internal libraries or packages
- Designing reusable components

**HostPlatformForContributors**
- Designing plugin/extension systems
- Building platforms that accept external contributions
- Framework development

**StandaloneComponent**
- Isolated experiments or proofs of concept
- Self-contained scripts or tools
- No integration with existing systems

**UpstreamIntegration**
- Consuming third-party APIs (Stripe, AWS, etc.)
- Integrating with external databases
- Using external SDKs or libraries

**BoundaryInterface**
- Designing public APIs
- Contract-first development
- Adapter patterns between systems

**OperationalService**
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Log aggregation configuration
- SRE and DevOps concerns

**SecurityBoundary**
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Data encryption decisions
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2)

**ProductFeature**
- User-facing functionality
- UX/UI decisions
- Feature flags and rollout strategies

**EcosystemArtifact**
- CLI tools for developers
- Starter templates and boilerplates
- Reference implementations

**LifecycleMigration**
- Database schema migrations
- API versioning strategies
- Deprecation timelines

**OwnershipGovernance**
- Team ownership boundaries
- Code review policies
- Process changes
