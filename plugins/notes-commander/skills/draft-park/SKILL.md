name: draft-park
description: Park a draft message/text in macOS Notes for the operator to review and edit, then read it back before acting (e.g. before sending to a real person). Notes is the source of truth (AppleScript CRUD, iCloud-synced, provenance-stamped with the Claude Code session UUID); Stickies is a best-effort view-only desktop mirror. Use whenever you draft something a human should confirm/edit before it is sent or committed — messages, replies, announcements, anything outbound. TRIGGERS - park this draft, park the message, hold this draft, let me edit first, draft for my approval, save to notes for review, read back the draft.

# draft-park — human-in-the-loop drafts via macOS Notes

> Renamed from `draft-hold` on 2026-08-12. Invoke as `/notes-commander:draft-park`; there is no `draft-hold` alias. Evolution-log entries dated before the rename keep the old name — that is the accurate historical record, not drift.

> **Self-Evolving skill** — if macOS Notes/Stickies behavior drifts from what's below, fix this SKILL.md and the shared engine `scripts/lib/notes-core.ts` (+ a case in `notes-core.test.ts`); see the Post-Execution Reflection at the bottom.

When you compose something a human should confirm or edit before it goes out (a message to a real person, an announcement, a commit body), **don't keep it only in chat** — park it in macOS Notes so the operator can edit it on any device, then read it back and act on the edited version.

**Resolve the entrypoint first** — `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is NOT a shell variable and expands to empty here (it exists only inside plugin manifests and hook/MCP subprocesses; see the `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` invariant in the plugin CLAUDE.md). Never glob the version cache either — it retains orphaned versions. Use the resolver:

```bash
DP="$(cc-plugin-root notes-commander)/skills/draft-park/draft-park.sh"
```

`draft-park.sh` is a thin shim that `exec`s the **Bun/TypeScript engine** `scripts/draft-park.ts`, built on the plugin's shared `notes-core` engine (which also powers `notes-inventory`/`notes-export`/`notes-organize`).

## Formatting is handled in code — just write naturally

The engine (formatter in `scripts/lib/notes-core.ts`, unit-tested in `notes-core.test.ts`) normalizes your input into Notes HTML, so you never hand-manage line breaks:

- **Prose reflows.** Consecutive non-blank lines join into ONE paragraph that Notes soft-wraps to the reader's screen. Accidental hard-wrapping (text pre-wrapped at ~80/100 cols) is corrected automatically — it can no longer become a permanent mid-sentence break. Blank lines are the only breaks that matter.
- **A blank line = a new paragraph/section.** That is the one authored break.
- **List items** — lines beginning with `-`, `*`, `+`, `•`, `1.`, `2)`, `a.` etc. each stay on their own line; a wrapped continuation line (indented, no marker) joins back to its item.
- **Verbatim / columnar / code blocks** — wrap them in a ` ``` ` fence. Every line inside is preserved exactly and rendered monospace with spaces held (via `&nbsp;`), so columns and IDs line up **in the Notes UI**. (Note: `get --body-only` returns the _sendable_ plain text and collapses inter-column runs to single spaces; if exact alignment must survive to the recipient, send an attachment/screenshot.)

## Hardening (verified failure modes this engine guards)

- **Silent-failure detection** — `new` asserts Notes returned a real note id (`x-coredata://…`); on recent macOS, osascript can exit 0 yet create nothing. If that happens you get a loud `✗ SILENT-FAILURE` instead of a phantom "success".
- **Bounded retry** — transient AppleEvent errors (`-600`/`-1712`/"not running") retry with backoff; permission/syntax errors fail fast.
- **Read-back verify (default ON)** — after `new`, the note is read back and checked for entity leaks and content presence. `--no-verify` skips (rarely needed).

## Workflow

1. **Park the draft** (body on STDIN):

   ```bash
   CLAUDE_SESSION_ID="$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" "$DP" new "<title>" --project "<repo-or-context>" <<'EOF'
   Hi <name> — <your drafted message>...
   EOF
   ```

   Creates/replaces a note in the **"Claude Drafts"** folder with a provenance footer (session UUID + project + timestamp). Tell the operator: _"Draft is in Notes → Claude Drafts → <title>; edit it there, then tell me to send."_

2. **(Optional) desktop mirror** — `"$DP" sticky "<title>"` pops a view-only Stickies note (needs Accessibility permission). Notes stays authoritative.

3. **Read it back** before acting — ALWAYS re-read, since the operator may have edited it:

   ```bash
   "$DP" get "<title>"              # full note (heading + message + provenance footer)
   "$DP" get "<title>" --body-only  # JUST the sendable message (no heading, no footer)
   ```

   Use `--body-only` to get exactly the text to send/paste — it strips the title heading and everything from the `------` provenance separator onward. Show the operator the exact current text, get explicit go-ahead, then send/commit.

4. `"$DP" list` enumerates parked drafts.

## macOS quirks this skill handles for you

- **Quote serialization**: Notes' AppleScript `body` getter re-emits every `"` as the _semicolon-less_ legacy entity `&quot` (verified 2026-06-29). We decode with `textutil` (a real HTML parser) instead of `sed`, so `&quot`/`&amp`/`&lt` etc. round-trip back to literal characters. Never hand-roll entity decoding here. The read-back verify now DETECTS a drift here automatically (`✗ ENTITY-LEAK`). **A real HTML parser is not sufficient on its own** (fixed 2026-07-20): because the stored form is semicolon-LESS, a note holding `Write-Host "x"; $y` comes back raw as `Write-Host &quotx&quot; $y`, and textutil reads the closing `&quot` plus the author's own `;` as one entity — silently eating the semicolon, so it round-tripped as `Write-Host "x" $y`. That corrupts most staged PowerShell/C/Java/JS with no error, which is fatal for a skill whose job is staging text a human will SEND. `terminateLegacyEntities()` in `notes-core.ts` now appends the `;` to every bare entity before decoding, so a following literal `;` stays literal. This is safe unconditionally because Notes escapes every `&` it stores (an author's literal `&amp;` comes back as `&ampamp;`), so a terminated entity in Notes output can only ever be bare-entity + the author's semicolon.
- **UTF-8 decode needs an explicit charset**: `textutil -format html` assumes Latin-1 when the HTML has no charset declaration, mojibaking every non-ASCII character (关于 → `å…³äºŽ`; verified 2026-07-02 with a Chinese draft). `htmlToText` therefore prepends `<meta charset="utf-8">` before piping to textutil — keep that prefix.
- **Note name = first body line, TRUNCATED**: Notes names a note after its first line, ignoring any title you "set". `new` therefore prepends the title as a bold first line so `get`/`list`/replace can find it by title. Pass the message body only on STDIN. **But Notes truncates a long first line** to a capped `name` ending in an ellipsis `…` (verified 2026-07-20: a 66-char title stored as `…(2026-07-20…`), so an exact `whose name is <title>` lookup MISSES long-titled notes. The engine handles this: `new` reads its note back **by id** (not title) for the verify, and `get`/`sticky`/`move-note` resolve a title to a note **truncation-tolerantly** via `noteNameMatchesTitle()` (exact, else the stored name is the title truncated with a trailing `…`). Never rely on exact-name AppleScript matching for a possibly-long title.
- **Links: the SETTER keeps them, the GETTER strips them** (verified 2026-08-05). Write `[label](url)` and the engine emits `<a href>`; Notes stores a genuine link attribute (confirmed by decompressing the note's `ZICNOTEDATA.ZDATA` protobuf in `NoteStore.sqlite` — the href sits in the attribute run while the visible-text run holds only the label). But AppleScript's `body` **getter returns `<u>label</u>` with no href**, for links Notes itself made too. Consequences: (1) `get`/`get --body-only` shows link TEXT and silently loses the URL — never round-trip a linked note through `get` and re-`new` it, the links will be gone; (2) read-back verify is link-blind by construction, so `renderInline`'s unit tests are the only place an href is observable — do not "harden" verify by asserting hrefs, they never appear. Only `http(s)` and `mailto` become anchors; any other scheme (`javascript:`, `file:`, a bare path) renders as literal text.
- **Proportional prose, monospace only in fences**: prose paragraphs render in Notes' normal proportional font (so a long line reflows). Only ` ``` ` fenced blocks are wrapped in `<tt>` (Notes' "Monostyled" face) with spaces held as `&nbsp;`. The mono face is fixed by Notes — it is _not_ the global `NSFixedPitchFont`, which governs TextEdit-style apps, not Notes.

## Getting the session UUID for provenance

**The Bash tool already has it**: Claude Code exports `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (verified 2026-08-05 — matches the `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<uuid>.jsonl` name). So just forward it, and don't go hunting:

```bash
CLAUDE_SESSION_ID="$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" "$DP" new "<title>" …
```

Only if that variable is empty: the `statusline-tools:session-info` skill reports the UUID, or read the newest `*.jsonl` under `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/`. If genuinely unavailable, omit it (the footer drops the token — never write a placeholder).

## Rules

- **Never send/commit from memory** — always `get` the note first; the operator may have changed it.
- Notes is the source of truth. Stickies cannot be read back (no AppleScript dictionary), so never treat a sticky as the live draft.
- There is no scriptable deep-link to a specific note (`open x-coredata://…` fails; `applenotes:` links are UI-only) — reference drafts by **folder + title**.
- First run prompts once for Automation permission to control Notes.

## Evolution log

- **2026-08-12 — renamed `draft-hold` → `draft-park`.** _Trigger_: operator directive — "park" is the verb the skill's own docs and triggers already used ("park it in macOS Notes", "park the message"), while "hold" read as a queue/blocking state. _Scope_: skill dir `skills/draft-hold/` → `skills/draft-park/`, shim `draft-hold.sh` → `draft-park.sh`, engine `scripts/draft-hold.ts` → `scripts/draft-park.ts`, call-site variable `$DH` → `$DP`, and every live cross-reference (plugin CLAUDE.md/README/plugin.json, marketplace.json, root + plugins CLAUDE.md, `scripts/cc-plugin-root` usage example, macos-font-defaults' Notes-mono cross-reference, and the operator's live `~/.claude` instructions). **No `draft-hold` alias exists** — the slash command is `/notes-commander:draft-park` only. _Deliberately NOT rewritten_: CHANGELOG.md, the entries below this one, and the itp-hooks skill-plugin-root-guard forensics — those describe events that happened under the old name, and back-dating a rename into them would make the incident record wrong. _Behavior_: unchanged — same subcommands, same flags, same "Claude Drafts" Notes folder, so previously parked notes are still found by `get`/`list`. The one content change: the provenance footer now reads `Parked by Claude Code` (was `Held by`). Nothing parses it — `bodyOnly()` cuts at the `------` separator — so notes written under the old wording read back identically.
- **2026-08-05 (b) — the skill could not find its own entrypoint (`exit 127`).** _Trigger_: `/notes-commander:draft-hold` invoked from another repo died on `(eval):1: no such file or directory: /skills/draft-hold/draft-hold.sh`. _Root cause_: this SKILL.md told the caller to use `DH="$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/draft-hold/draft-hold.sh"`, but **`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not a shell variable**. Claude Code substitutes the exact literal `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (braces REQUIRED — the helper is `e.replace(/\$\{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT\}/g, pluginPath)`) inside plugin manifests, and injects the var into hook/MCP subprocess envs — never into the Bash tool. The bare `$…` spelling used here is unsubstitutable on every path, so it reached zsh as an unset var, expanded to empty, and produced an absolute-looking `/skills/…` path — which reads like a missing file, not a missing variable. Two upstream causes made it likely: the repo's own `advanced-topics.md` and `lifecycle-reference.md` documented the rule **exactly backwards** ("available in skill loading, NOT in hooks" — it is the reverse), and the recovery path was equally unsound: globbing the version cache and taking the highest semver picked `23.4.1`, which is marked `.orphaned_at` (live was `23.5.0`). _Fix_: added `scripts/cc-plugin-root` (reads `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`, tolerates both registry schemas, jq with a python3 fallback, symlinked into `~/.local/bin/`); this SKILL.md now resolves `DH="$(cc-plugin-root notes-commander)/skills/draft-hold/draft-hold.sh"`; both reference docs corrected; the stale "L3 cache strips `scripts/`" claim retired. Also stopped the sibling waste in this same flow: `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` is already exported into the Bash env, so the provenance UUID no longer needs hunting. _Evidence_: resolver returns the live `23.5.0` path via both jq and python3 backends and under both registry shapes; negative cases exit 1/2 with actionable stderr; the resolved `draft-hold.sh` and `scripts/draft-hold.ts` both exist.
- **2026-08-05 (a) — every URL had to be shown naked, because the formatter escaped anchors.** _Trigger_: staging a weekly report whose 16 PR references made the prose unreadable; the operator asked for `#470`-style link text and supplied a screenshot of a working link in Notes, proving Notes supports them. _Root cause_: `escapeHtml()` was applied to every prose and list line, so an `<a href>` could only ever render as literal `&lt;a href…`. _The trap that nearly ended the investigation_: a probe note written with `<a href>` read back as `<u>#470</u>`, which looks exactly like "Notes stripped the link" — I nearly concluded the setter was broken. The operator's OWN hand-made link read back as `<u>link text</u>` too, which is what exposed the real shape: the **getter** is lossy, not the setter. Confirmed by decompressing `ZICNOTEDATA.ZDATA` from `NoteStore.sqlite` — the probe note's visible text was `See #470 and #472.` while the hrefs sat in the attribute run. A read-back-only check would have produced a false negative and no links. _Fix_: added pure, unit-tested `renderInline()` promoting `[label](url)` → `<a href>` at the three prose/list call sites (fences stay verbatim, so a fenced `[x](url)` renders literally); `http(s)`/`mailto` allow-list so a `javascript:` link can never be minted into a document a human will click. _Evidence_: 6 new unit tests (**39 pass, 0 fail**), plus a live round-trip verified against the SQLite protobuf — 16 hrefs stored, zero URLs leaked into visible prose.
- **2026-07-27 — a lead-in line silently ate the list under it.** _Trigger_: staging a real reply draft, `解决办法有两个，你倾向哪个？` immediately followed by two `-` bullets (no blank line) came back from `get --body-only` as ONE run-on line, bullets and all. Hit twice in the same session, in two different notes. _Root cause_: `renderTextBlock()` classified each blank-line-delimited paragraph by testing **`p[0]` only** — so a paragraph whose first line is prose was rendered wholly as prose, and `reflowJoin()` folded the following `-`/`1.` markers into it. The list was destroyed with no error. This contradicted SKILL.md, which promised list markers "each stay on their own line", and left an undocumented "you must leave a blank line before a list" rule that authors could only learn by being bitten. _Fix_: split each paragraph at the FIRST line matching `LIST_RE` — lead-in lines reflow as prose, everything from the first marker on renders per-item via the new extracted `renderListItems()` helper (also removes the duplicated item-grouping loop). All three shapes now work: all-prose, all-list, and lead-in-then-list. _Evidence_: 3 new unit tests (CJK lead-in + bullets, English lead-in + numbered list, multi-line lead-in that must still reflow before splitting); **33 pass, 0 fail**.
- **2026-07-20 (b) — unified the truncation-match rule into one home (DRY).** The 2026-07-20 (a) fix left the exact-then-truncated matching rule in TWO places: `noteNameMatchesTitle()` in `notes-core.ts` (used by draft-hold) AND a hand-copied AppleScript scan inside `notes.ts` `OSA_MOVE`, guarded only by a "keep the two rules in step" comment. _Fix_: added pure `matchNoteIds(index, title)` to `notes-core.ts` (exact ids first, else truncation-tolerant; returns every match so callers can flag ambiguity). `move-note` now indexes the source folder (`OSA_NOTE_INDEX_BY_PATH`), resolves the title in TS via `matchNoteIds`, and moves by **id** (`OSA_MOVE_BY_ID`); the name-matching AppleScript is deleted. draft-hold's own resolver + dedup route through `matchNoteIds` too. One rule, unit-tested (5 new tests, 30 total), impossible to drift. Invariant recorded in the plugin CLAUDE.md (the `matchNoteIds` entry).
- **2026-07-20 (a) — long titles broke read-back verify + `move-note` (name truncation).** _Trigger_: parking a 66-char draft ("CPC Scanners — Procurement Intelligence & Deliverables (2026-07-20)") returned a false `✗ CONTENT-MISMATCH`, and `move-note "<that title>"` then failed with "note not found in source folder", even though the note existed and its body was correct. _Root cause_: macOS Notes stores a long first-line `name` TRUNCATED with a trailing `…`, so `new`'s read-back (`body of note <title> of folder`) and `move-note`'s `whose name is <title>` both looked up a name that no longer equalled the title. _Fix_: added the pure, unit-tested `noteNameMatchesTitle()` + `NOTES_NAME_ELLIPSIS` to `notes-core.ts` (exact, else truncated-prefix match); `new` now verifies **by id** (`OSA_GET_BY_ID`) and dedups older copies via a JS-side folder index; `get`/`sticky` resolve title→id truncation-tolerantly; `move-note` (notes.ts) falls back to a truncated-prefix scan that captures matches **by id** (a live `notes of src` reference held past the loop throws `-1728`). _Evidence_: a 125-char-title probe now creates (clean id, no CONTENT-MISMATCH), `get`s its body, and `move-note`s across folders — all green; 5 new unit tests (25 pass total). Verified live on macOS Notes.
- **2026-07-18 (b) — migrated into notes-commander + hardened.** The standalone draft-hold plugin was folded into the new `notes-commander` plugin as one of its skills; formatting + process wrappers moved to the shared `scripts/lib/notes-core.ts` engine. Added, per a web-researched audit of recent macOS AppleScript failure modes: silent-no-op detection (`isNoteId` on create — osascript can exit 0 yet create nothing on macOS 26), bounded retry on transient AppleEvent errors (`-600`/`-1712`), and a default-on read-back verify (`entityLeaks` + `contentPresent`). All pure helpers unit-tested (16 tests in `notes-core.test.ts`).
- **2026-07-18 (a) — hard-wrapped prose became forced mid-sentence breaks.** A long bilingual briefing was passed with each paragraph pre-wrapped at ~100 chars; because the old bash `new` made each input line its own Notes paragraph (all wrapped in `<tt>`), the reader saw mid-sentence line breaks that did not reflow. _First fix (insufficient)_: a "one line per paragraph" caller contract — but that only works if every caller remembers it. _Real fix_: reimplemented the engine as **Bun/TypeScript**, enforcing the formatting in code so the failure is impossible: prose blocks REFLOW (consecutive lines join; blank line = paragraph), list markers stay per-item, and only ` ``` ` fenced blocks are preserved verbatim/monospace (spaces held as `&nbsp;`). Verified by unit tests + a live Notes round-trip.

## Post-Execution Reflection

After holding or sending a draft, check before closing:

1. **Did read-back match what Notes shows?** — if entities/quotes leaked (e.g. `&quot`), the decode path drifted; the verify step should have caught it — fix the `textutil` step in `notes-core.ts`, never hand-roll sed.
2. **Did `get`/`list` find the note by title?** — if not, the name==title assumption broke; fix the title-prepend in `new`.
3. **Did Notes/Stickies change behavior?** — update the macOS-quirks section so the next run doesn't rediscover it.

Only update if the issue is real and reproducible — not speculative.
