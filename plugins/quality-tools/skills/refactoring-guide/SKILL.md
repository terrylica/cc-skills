# Refactoring Guide

Principles that LLMs consistently get wrong during refactoring. This skill corrects systematic blind spots around coupling analysis, type-level design, module boundaries, and safe migration strategies.

The core problem: LLMs optimize for what code _looks like_ (structural similarity), but good modularization optimizes for how code _changes together_ (temporal cohesion). Every principle here addresses that gap.

## When to Use

- **Refactoring tasks**: Extract module, split file, reduce coupling, reorganize
- **Code review**: Spot smells and suggest the right fix (not the superficial one)
- **Architecture decisions**: Module boundaries, dependency direction, integration points
- **Proactively**: When you detect any signal from the Detection Heuristics table below

## Workflow

When refactoring, follow this sequence:

1. **Detect** — Scan the code against the Detection Heuristics table. Identify which smells are present.
2. **Diagnose** — For each smell, read the corresponding reference file to understand the correct principle.
3. **Plan** — Design the refactoring using the right technique. For multi-file changes (>3 files), use the Mikado Method (see `references/architecture.md`).
4. **Execute** — Apply changes. For shared interfaces, use expand-contract (see `references/tactical-moves.md`).
5. **Verify** — Confirm the refactoring reduced the specific coupling type identified in step 1.

## Detection Heuristics

Scan for these signals to identify which principle to apply:

## Principle Summary

Each principle is covered in detail in `references/`. Read the relevant file when you encounter its smell.

### Structural Coupling (`references/structural-coupling.md`)

1. **Seam identification** — Find natural seams before extracting; don't cut across them
2. **Connascence spectrum** — Coupling has 9 strength levels; refactor toward weaker forms
3. **Stability metrics** — Depend in the direction of stability (lower instability)
4. **Divergent change vs. shotgun surgery** — Opposites requiring opposite fixes; don't confuse them
5. **Data ownership** — Every data structure has one owning module; others read via contracts, never mutate
6. **Volatility isolation** — Wrap high-churn dependencies behind narrow stable interfaces

### Type-Level Design (`references/type-design.md`)

1. **Parse, don't validate** — Parse at boundaries into typed results; never pass raw input downstream
2. **Make illegal states unrepresentable** — Discriminated unions over boolean/optional fields
3. **Newtype / branded types** — Wrap primitives with distinct types to prevent semantic confusion
4. **Temporal coupling → type-state** — Return new types that expose only currently-valid methods

### Architecture (`references/architecture.md`)

1. **Functional core, imperative shell** — Pure functions for decisions, thin IO shell for effects
2. **Anti-corruption layer** — Translate external models at integration boundaries
3. **Strangler fig** — Incremental migration, never big-bang rewrites
4. **Mikado method** — For large refactors: try, record failures, revert, work bottom-up
5. **Composition root** — All wiring at one entry point, not scattered through modules

### Module Boundaries (`references/module-boundaries.md`)

1. **Package by feature, not layer** — Vertical slicing keeps feature changes local
2. **Acyclic dependencies** — Module graph must be a DAG
3. **Common closure** — Group by reason-for-change, not technical similarity
4. **Interface segregation** — Don't force consumers to depend on unused exports
5. **Invariant enforcement** — Modules defend their own invariants; expose operations, not setters
6. **Error boundary translation** — Each module translates errors to its own domain vocabulary

### Tactical Moves (`references/tactical-moves.md`)

1. **Deletion as refactoring** — Best refactoring often has negative line count
2. **Rule of three** — Wait for three instances before abstracting
3. **Inline then re-extract** — Flatten confused code first, then re-decompose cleanly
4. **Expand-contract** — For shared interfaces: add new alongside old, migrate, remove old
5. **Boolean parameter prohibition** — Split or use enum instead
6. **Configuration as explicit dependency** — Pass config, don't import globally
7. **Characterization tests first** — Pin behavior before refactoring
8. **Conway's law alignment** — Module boundaries should match team boundaries
9. **Over-modularization check** — Boundary must improve change isolation, not just organize files
10. **Module documentation template** — For each module: responsibility, ownership, dependencies, invariants, error model

### Rust-Specific (`references/rust-specific.md`)

Read when refactoring Rust codebases. Covers visibility as architecture, public API surface control, crate vs. module boundaries, Cargo features, workspace feature unification, and dependency policy tooling.

### Swift/macOS-Specific (`references/swift-macos-specific.md`)

Read when refactoring Swift codebases on macOS. Covers access control as architecture (`package` modifier), explicit import visibility (SE-0409), target/framework boundary selection, macro isolation, and API governance tooling.
