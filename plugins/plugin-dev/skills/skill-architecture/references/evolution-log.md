## 2026-02-13: Fix Hook Integration Anti-Pattern (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT)

**Trigger**: The `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` variable was recommended in the Hook Integration Pattern (advanced-topics.md) but does NOT work in hooks.json commands. When hooks.json is synced to settings.json, the variable is copied verbatim and resolves to empty string at shell execution time, causing "Module not found" errors.

### Anti-Patterns Documented

1. **`$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in hooks.json**: This env var only exists inside Claude Code's internal plugin skill loading context, not as a shell environment variable. Hook commands must use `$HOME`-based absolute paths.
2. **Empty TOML table sections**: mise rejects `[hooks.enter]` containing only comments (no key-value pairs). Either add a key or remove the section.

### Changes Made

1. **advanced-topics.md**: Replaced `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` example with `$HOME`-based path, added anti-pattern callout with comparison table, fixed guideline #6
2. **lifecycle-reference.md** (itp-hooks): Clarified `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` documentation, added both anti-patterns to Common Pitfalls table

### Key Insight

Plugin context variables (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`) are available when Claude Code loads skills but NOT when hook commands execute as shell processes from settings.json. The sync script copies hooks.json commands verbatim without variable resolution. Only standard shell env vars (`$HOME`) are safe in hook commands.

## 2026-02-13: Extract Advanced Patterns from tts-telegram-sync

**Trigger**: The tts-telegram-sync plugin (8 skills, 3 commands, hooks, shared library) demonstrated 10 advanced patterns not captured in skill-architecture. These were extracted as agnostic, universally applicable patterns.

### Changes Made

1. **structural-patterns.md**: Added Pattern 5 (Suite Pattern) for multi-skill lifecycle management
2. **New: phased-execution.md**: Preflight/Execute/Verify pattern with 3 variants (Sandwich Verification, Dependency-Aware Teardown, Config Read-Edit-Validate-Apply) and TodoWrite phase labels
3. **New: command-skill-duality.md**: When to use commands vs skills, complementary design, plugin layout with both
4. **New: interactive-patterns.md**: 5 AskUserQuestion patterns (intent branching, destructive confirmation, config group selection, symptom collection, feedback collection)
5. **advanced-topics.md**: Added Known Issue Table pattern and Hook Integration pattern
6. **scripts-reference.md**: Added Shared Library pattern (scripts/lib/ convention)
7. **creation-workflow.md**: Added lifecycle and interactive questions to Steps 1-2, expanded decision matrix
8. **SKILL.md**: Added Suite Pattern to structural patterns list, Template F for lifecycle suites, 2 checklist items, 3 new reference links, expanded trigger keywords in description

### Key Insight

A single mature plugin demonstrated patterns that individual simple skills never encounter. The Suite Pattern is a fundamentally new structural category alongside Workflow, Task, Reference, and Capabilities. All patterns were generalized to use generic domain language (service, component, integration) with no TTS/Telegram-specific references.

## 2025-12-04: Expand Path Patterns for Script Portability

**Trigger**: Multi-agent audit found hardcoded paths across all skills/scripts.

### Problem

Path-patterns.md only covered markdown-specific patterns. Scripts had transgressions:

- `/Users/<username>/.claude/skills` (user-specific path)
- `/tmp/jscpd-report` (hardcoded temp directory)
- `~/.local/bin/graph-easy` (hardcoded binary location)

### Solution

1. Added 3 new unsafe patterns to `path-patterns.md`:
   - **Pattern 4**: Hardcoded user-specific paths (`/Users/<user>`, `/home/<user>`)
   - **Pattern 5**: Hardcoded temp directories (`/tmp`)
   - **Pattern 6**: Hardcoded binary locations (`~/.local/bin/tool`)

2. Expanded Validation Checklist with script-specific checks

3. Updated Skill Quality Checklist with inline examples:
   - Use `$HOME` not `/Users/<user>`
   - Use `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` not `/tmp`
   - Use `command -v` not hardcoded paths

### Key Insight

Portability requires discipline in BOTH markdown AND scripts. Multi-agent parallel audit is effective for finding distributed issues across a codebase.

## 2025-12-04: Add Path Patterns Reference

**Trigger**: `/itp:setup` command failed due to unsupported `$(dirname "$0")` pattern in markdown.

### Problem

Command markdown files used `$(dirname "$0")` to resolve script paths, but `$0` is not set in the context where Claude reads markdown files. This is a known Claude Code bug ([#9354](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9354)).

### Solution

1. Created `references/path-patterns.md` documenting:
   - **Safe patterns**: Explicit fallback paths, relative links, `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` in scripts
   - **Unsafe patterns**: `$(dirname "$0")` in markdown, bare `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` without fallback
   - **Related GitHub issues**: #9354, #11278
   - **Migration guide**: How to find and fix unsafe patterns

2. Added to Skill Quality Checklist:
   - "No unsafe path patterns in markdown"

3. Added to Reference Documentation list

### Key Insight

Environment variables and bash context (`$0`, `$SCRIPT_DIR`) behave differently in actual scripts vs. markdown documentation that Claude reads. Always use explicit fallback paths for marketplace plugins.

## 2025-12-04: Add Continuous Improvement Section

**Trigger**: User identified gap—skill had mechanics for self-evolution but no proactive trigger.

### Problem

Skill-architecture taught HOW to make skills self-evolving (Template D, Post-Change Checklist, evolution-log) but didn't instruct Claude to ACTIVELY WATCH for improvement opportunities during normal usage.

### Solution

Added "Continuous Improvement (Proactive Self-Evolution)" section with:

- **6 improvement signals** to watch for (friction, edge cases, better patterns, confusion, tool evolution, repeated steps)
- **Immediate Update Protocol** (pause → fix → log → resume)
- **What NOT to update** (guard rails)
- **Self-Reflection Trigger** (post-task question)

### Key Insight

The distinction between reactive (what to do after changes) and proactive (actively seeking improvements) is critical. Skills should be vigilant observers, not passive recipients.

## 2024-12-04: Adversarial Audit Round 3 (Multi-Agent)

**Trigger**: User spawned 5 parallel sub-agents for comprehensive audit.

### Agents Deployed

| Agent             | Perspective              | Severity Found |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| Structural        | Skill Anatomy compliance | NONE           |
| Template-Tutorial | Alignment check          | MEDIUM         |
| References        | Link integrity           | LOW            |
| Description       | YAML triggers            | MEDIUM         |
| Checklist         | Self-compliance          | CRITICAL       |

### Critical Fix

**Issue**: skill-architecture not registered in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
**Impact**: Violates its own teaching (Template A step 10, Tutorial Step 6)
**Fix**: Added "Global Skills" section to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`

### Medium Fixes

1. **YAML description** - Added specific trigger keywords: "YAML frontmatter", "validate skill", "TodoWrite templates", "bundled resources", "progressive disclosure", "allowed-tools"

2. **Orphaned file** - Added `workflow-patterns.md` to Reference Documentation

3. **Template ordering** - Swapped steps 4↔5 in Template A to match tutorial advice ("resources first, then SKILL.md")

### Low Fix

**Orphaned file**: `workflow-patterns.md` existed but wasn't referenced. Added to Reference Documentation section.

### Key Insight

Multi-agent parallel audit with different perspectives finds issues single-pass review misses. Critical issue (not registered in CLAUDE.md) was ironic - the skill teaches the very thing it violated.

## 2024-12-04: Adversarial Audit Round 2

**Trigger**: User requested second adversarial review to find remaining flaws.

### Flaws Found

| #   | Flaw                                                 | Location      |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| 1   | Skill Anatomy incomplete - missing evolution-log.md  | Lines 213-219 |
| 2   | Template D assumes config-reference.md always needed | Line 66       |
| 3   | Templates don't reference detailed tutorial          | Lines 18-83   |
| 4   | "6 Steps" title misleading vs 11-step Template A     | Line 124      |

### Changes Made

1. **Skill Anatomy updated** - Added `references/evolution-log.md` as recommended structure
2. **Template D step 5** - Changed to "(if skill manages external config)"
3. **Added cross-reference** - Templates section now links to tutorial
4. **Renamed section** - "6 Steps" → "Detailed Tutorial" with note to use templates

### Key Insight

Adversarial self-review catches inconsistencies that initial implementation misses. Two passes are better than one.

## 2024-12-04: TodoWrite-First Pattern + Self-Alignment

**Trigger**: User identified skill-architecture didn't follow its own standards.

### Changes Made

1. **Added TodoWrite Task Templates section** (FIRST section after frontmatter)
   - Template A: Create New Skill (11 steps)
   - Template B: Update Existing Skill
   - Template C: Add Resources to Skill
   - Template D: Convert to Self-Evolving Skill
   - Template E: Troubleshoot Skill Not Triggering
   - Skill Quality Checklist

2. **Added Post-Change Checklist (Self-Maintenance)**
   - skill-architecture now maintains itself like other skills

3. **Updated Step 4: Edit the Skill**
   - Added requirements for TodoWrite Task Templates
   - Added requirements for Post-Change Checklist

4. **Updated Step 6: Register and Iterate**
   - Added "Register skill in project CLAUDE.md"
   - Added "Verify against Skill Quality Checklist"

5. **Created this evolution-log.md**
   - skill-architecture is now self-documenting

### Flaws Fixed

| Flaw                              | Resolution                                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 6 Steps vs Template A misaligned  | Updated 6 Steps to include registration and checklist verification |
| No Post-Change Checklist for self | Added Self-Maintenance section                                     |
| Not self-evolving                 | Created evolution-log.md                                           |
| Step 4 incomplete                 | Added TodoWrite templates + Checklist requirements                 |

### Key Insight

The meta-skill that teaches skill creation must itself be an exemplar. Any pattern it teaches (TodoWrite templates, Post-Change Checklist, evolution tracking) must be present in itself.
