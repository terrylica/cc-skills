# /floating-clock:launch

Open the FloatingClock app.

> **Self-Evolving Skill**: This skill improves through use. If the launch path or fallback logic breaks — fix this file immediately, don't defer. Only update for real, reproducible issues.

## Steps

Prefer the installed app; fall back to the local build if the user hasn't installed yet:

```bash
if [ -d /Applications/FloatingClock.app ]; then
  open /Applications/FloatingClock.app
  echo "Launched from /Applications/"
else
  PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/cc-skills/plugins/floating-clock}"
  LOCAL_APP="$PLUGIN_ROOT/build/FloatingClock.app"
  if [ -d "$LOCAL_APP" ]; then
    open "$LOCAL_APP"
    echo "Launched from local build at $LOCAL_APP"
    echo "Tip: run /floating-clock:install to put it in /Applications/ for Spotlight access."
  else
    echo "No app found. Run /floating-clock:install first."
    exit 1
  fi
fi
```

## Post-Execution Reflection

After this skill completes, check before closing:

1. **Did `open` succeed silently?** — If macOS surfaced a gatekeeper prompt, document the bypass.
2. **Did the fallback to local build trigger when expected?** — If the user has the installed app but it's stale, the system path wins; that's intentional.
3. **Did paths drift?** — `/Applications/FloatingClock.app` or local build path change → update the script.

Only update if the issue is real and reproducible — not speculative.
