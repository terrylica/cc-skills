/**
 * reflow-release-notes — unwrap hard-wrapped prose before publishing a GitHub Release.
 *
 * GitHub renders release, issue and PR bodies with GFM hard line breaks: a single newline inside a
 * paragraph becomes a real `<br>`. Prose wrapped at a fixed column therefore renders as ragged,
 * mid-sentence breaks that ignore the reader's viewport instead of reflowing to it. It is invisible
 * in the source and shows up only on the published page.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES HERE. The doctrine (~/.claude/release-notes-doctrine-CLAUDE.md § "NEVER hard-wrap
 * the release body") says to enforce this in code rather than as a rule callers must remember, and
 * to port the reference implementation into the releasing repo. cc-skills previously enforced the
 * EXTENSIVENESS half of the doctrine in code (scripts/augment-release-notes.mjs measures narrative +
 * point form) while leaving the wrapping half to memory — so the published v26.0.1 body went out
 * hard-wrapped at ~68-71 columns, which `--check` on this file reproduces.
 *
 * The wrapping is not an authoring mistake to scold: git commit BODIES are correctly hard-wrapped at
 * ~72 columns, and release notes are assembled from them. The wrap is right in the commit and wrong
 * in the release, so the conversion belongs in the publisher.
 *
 * WHAT IS JOINED, AND WHAT IS NOT. Only PROSE is joined. Structure that depends on line boundaries is
 * preserved: fenced code blocks, headings, tables, blockquotes and horizontal rules.
 *
 * LIST ITEMS ARE JOINED TOO — this is the case everyone misses. A bullet whose text was wrapped must
 * fold back onto one line, because its tail is prose inside the item rather than a new block, so a
 * newline there also renders as a `<br>` mid-sentence. Paragraphs reflowing correctly while bullets
 * still break is the signature of a reflow that treats a list marker as "emit and move on" instead of
 * "start a joinable block". (The upstream reference at work/project-b implements this correctly but its
 * header comment lists "list items" among the things preserved verbatim, which reads as the opposite
 * of what its code does; corrected here.)
 *
 *   bun scripts/reflow-release-notes.ts < notes.md > flat.md
 *   bun scripts/reflow-release-notes.ts --check < notes.md   # exit 1 if it would change anything
