# Search & Discovery Architecture

**Task**: Task 5: Search & Discovery Architecture  
**Author**: NiceXenon  
**Date**: 2026-03-02

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current search and discovery mechanisms in the cc-skills ecosystem and provides recommendations for a unified discovery architecture. The ecosystem contains **23 plugins** with **164 SKILL.md files**, yet lacks comprehensive cross-referencing and search capabilities.

---

## Current Discovery Mechanisms

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke Navigation Model

The primary navigation follows a hierarchical structure:

```
Root CLAUDE.md (Hub)
    ├── plugins/CLAUDE.md (Spoke 1)
    │       └── {plugin}/CLAUDE.md (Deep)
    └── docs/CLAUDE.md (Spoke 2)
            └── Various topic docs
```

**Link Density Analysis:**

- Root CLAUDE.md: 14 outbound links
- plugins/CLAUDE.md: 27 outbound links (21 plugin CLAUDE.md files)
- docs/CLAUDE.md: 8 outbound links to sub-docs

**Finding**: The hub-and-spoke model works well for initial orientation but lacks depth in cross-referencing between spokes.

### 2. Skill Discovery (Slash Commands)

Skills are discovered via:

1. **Frontmatter metadata** in each SKILL.md:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: adr-graph-easy-architect
   description: ASCII architecture diagrams...
   allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit
   ---
   ```

2. **Slash command invocation**: Users type `/<skill-name>` to invoke

3. **Trigger phrases** (stored in description): e.g., "TRIGGERS - ADR diagram, architecture diagram"

**Statistics:**

- 164 SKILL.md files across 23 plugins
- Skills organized in `plugins/{plugin}/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` structure

**Finding**: No unified skill index. Users must know the plugin name or browse plugin directories.

### 3. Plugin Registry (marketplace.json)

The Single Source of Truth (SSoT) is `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

- Contains 23 plugin entries with:
  - `name`, `description`, `version`
  - `keywords` array (searchable)
  - `category` (enumeration)
  - `author`, `source`, `hooks`

**Keywords for discovery:**

- plugin-dev: ["plugin", "skill", "validation", "silent-failures", "meta-skill"...]
- itp: ["adr", "workflow", "implementation", "preflight", "graph-easy"...]
- gh-tools: ["github", "pull-request", "gfm", "link-validation"...]

**Finding**: Keywords provide some discoverability but are not exposed to end users in the Claude Code interface.

### 4. Link Validation (Lychee)

The `lychee.toml` configuration provides broken link detection:

- Caches results for 7 days
- Excludes external URLs with rate limits
- Checks markdown files across the ecosystem

**Finding**: Validates link integrity but doesn't provide search functionality.

### 5. Validation Script (validate-plugins.mjs)

Comprehensive validation that checks:

- Plugin registration in marketplace.json
- Required fields in JSON entries
- Source/hook paths exist
- Skill frontmatter (name + description)
- Inter-plugin dependencies

**Finding**: Enforces structure but doesn't enhance user discovery.

## Discoverability Gaps

### Gap 1: No Unified Skill Index

- **Problem**: 164 skills exist but no single place lists them all
- **Impact**: Users can't discover skills across plugins
- **Example**: A user looking for "link validation" doesn't know it exists in `link-tools` plugin

### Gap 2: No Full-Text Search

- **Problem**: Cannot search skill descriptions or content
- **Impact**: Users must manually browse or guess
- **Example**: Searching for "markdown" returns no results across skills

### Gap 3: Weak Cross-Spoke Links

- **Problem**: docs/CLAUDE.md and plugins/CLAUDE.md don't fully link to each other
- **Impact**: Documentation is siloed
- **Finding**: Root CLAUDE.md links to both spokes, but spokes rarely link to each other

### Gap 4: Category/Tag Browsing Absent

- **Problem**: marketplace.json has `category` and `keywords` but no UI exposure
- **Impact**: No way to browse by category (devops, productivity, trading...)
- **Example**: Want all "productivity" plugins → must check marketplace.json manually

### Gap 5: No Skill-to-Skill References

- **Problem**: Skills don't reference related skills in other plugins
- **Impact**: No way to discover "similar" skills

### Gap 6: Plugin Dependencies Not Exposed

- **Problem**: `tts-tg-sync` requires `kokoro-tts` but this isn't visible to users
- **Impact**: Users don't understand plugin relationships

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Create Unified Skill Index (Priority: High)

**File**: `docs/discovery/skill-index.md`

```markdown
# Skill Index

Browse skills by category or search by keyword.

## All Skills (164)

| Skill                    | Plugin | Description                 | Triggers                  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| adr-graph-easy-architect | itp    | ASCII architecture diagrams | ADR diagram, architecture |

...
```

**Benefit**: Single navigation point for all skills.

### Recommendation 2: Add Cross-Reference Links (Priority: High)

Enhance CLAUDE.md files with bidirectional links:

- **plugins/CLAUDE.md** → Add link to `docs/CLAUDE.md`
- **docs/CLAUDE.md** → Add link to `plugins/CLAUDE.md`
- Each plugin CLAUDE.md → Link to related skills in other plugins

**Example** (plugins/itp/CLAUDE.md):

```markdown
## Related Skills

- [link-validation](../link-tools/skills/validate/SKILL.md) - Lychee integration
```

### Recommendation 3: Generate Skill Metadata Index (Priority: Medium)

Create a machine-readable index for potential tooling:

**File**: `.claude-plugin/skill-index.json`

```json
{
  "skills": [
    {
      "name": "adr-graph-easy-architect",
      "plugin": "itp",
      "description": "ASCII architecture diagrams for ADRs via graph-easy",
      "triggers": ["adr", "diagram", "architecture"],
      "keywords": ["graph-easy", "ascii", "architecture"],
      "path": "plugins/itp/skills/adr-graph-easy-architect/SKILL.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Usage**: Enable future search tools, slash command autocomplete.

### Recommendation 4: Add Category Browsing to Root CLAUDE.md (Priority: Medium)

Enhance root CLAUDE.md with category-based plugin listing:

```markdown
## Plugins by Category

### Development (7)

- plugin-dev, gh-tools, rust-tools, devops-tools...

### Productivity (5)

- itp, gmail-commander, calcom-commander, mise, productivity-tools

### DevOps (5)

- devops-tools, asciinema-tools, git-town-workflow, kokoro-tts, tts-tg-sync

### Trading (2)

- mql5, quant-research
```

### Recommendation 5: Document Plugin Dependencies (Priority: Medium)

Add dependency visualization to root CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Plugin Dependencies
```

tts-tg-sync ──requires──► kokoro-tts
git-town-workflow ──requires──► git-town

```

```

### Recommendation 6: Enhance Skill Triggers (Priority: Low)

Standardize trigger phrase format across all SKILL.md files:

```yaml
---
name: adr-graph-easy-architect
description: ASCII architecture diagrams for ADRs via graph-easy
triggers:
  - adr diagram
  - architecture
  - graph-easy
  - ascii chart
allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Write
---
```

**Benefit**: Enables future NLP-based skill matching.

## Implementation Priority

| Priority | Recommendation           | Effort | Impact |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1        | Unified Skill Index      | Low    | High   |
| 2        | Cross-Reference Links    | Medium | High   |
| 3        | Skill Metadata Index     | Medium | Medium |
| 4        | Category Browsing        | Low    | Medium |
| 5        | Dependency Documentation | Low    | Low    |
| 6        | Enhanced Triggers        | High   | Low    |

## Conclusion

The cc-skills ecosystem has a solid hub-and-spoke navigation model but lacks unified discovery mechanisms for its 164 skills. The primary gaps are:

1. No central skill index
2. No full-text or keyword search
3. Weak cross-references between spokes
4. Hidden category/keyword metadata

Implementing Recommendations 1-4 would significantly improve discoverability with moderate effort.
